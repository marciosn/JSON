AUC in the News: International Medical Graduates Making a Big Contribution to U.S. Healthcare
]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>
 A feature article published in STAT News suggests that international medical graduates (IMGs) from schools like American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) &ldquo;just might help solve an urgent physician shortage in California and beyond.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Dr. Rina Seerke Teper (Class of 2015), a resident in the family medicine program at Riverside University Health System Medical Center, is one of those graduates. Her desire to become a doctor goes back to her childhood in the country of Georgia where she saw how her mother, a doctor, was able to heal and bring strength and comfort to patients during a time of civil war. Later, after moving to San Francisco, she volunteered in the San Francisco Free Clinic for the underserved and homeless. AUC provided her with a path to become a doctor.&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 In a state that will need an estimated 8,000 additional primary care doctors by 2030, IMG trained doctors are helping to alleviate the physician shortage&mdash;particularly in primary care. And with more than 480 graduates practicing in California, AUC is doing its part too.<br />

Miami-Area Students Create Care Kits for the Homless
]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<br />
 Fourth year student Katiana Garagozlo hosted a <a href="http://hashtaghappyperiod.org/">#HappyPeriod</a> packaging event at the Center for Haitian Studies in Miami, FL over the weekend. She and other clinical students from AUC collected and assembled 225 care kits full of menstrual hygiene products. On Saturday, February 18, they will distribute these kits to homeless women and shelters around the Miami area, including Lotus House, Miami Rescue Mission, and Camillus House.<br />
 <br />
 Katiana is the second AUC student to spearhead the #HappyPeriod social movement in Miami. Earlier this year, 4th year student Nicole Czapp began a Miami chapter after learning about the volunteer initiative, whose mission is to support anyone that is homeless, low-income, and/or living in poverty and includes LGBT,non-binary, teens, veterans, and the diabled.&nbsp;<br />
 <p>
 <strong><a href="~/blog/september-2016/helping-homeless-women-have-a-happyperiod.aspx">Related: Helping Homeless Women Have a #HappyPeriod</a></strong></p>
 <p>
 When asked why she continues to hold these feminine hygiene drives, Katiana cited a recent study conducted&nbsp;at Florida International University: Around 25% of women in Miami-Dade County are currently living below the poverty level. And the Institute for Women Policy Research found that women in Florida have lower access to health insurance coverage when compared to the national average.&nbsp;As future physicians, these statistics emphasize the importance of patient advocacy and community outreach, two things Katiana strongly believes in.<br />
 <br />
 &quot;To participate in #HappyPeriod is to give a voice to the disadvantaged patient population that AUC&nbsp;students in Miami have the privilege of serving,&quot; she said. &quot;It is a unique&nbsp;opportunity to further understand patients, which in turn creates more&nbsp;empathetic physicians, regardless of&nbsp;specialty.&quot;</p>

 <br />
 <strong>Q: What&rsquo;s one of the biggest lessons you&rsquo;ve taken away from RUSVM?</strong><br />
 <br />
 A: Take the time to listen. To create a successful student experience, you have to be willing to listen to feedback and to collaborate on ideas that can have a positive impact.<br />
 <br />
 <strong>Q: Give us an example of something that improved the student experience there.</strong><br />
 <br />
 A: I initiated a &ldquo;Lunch with Leadership&rdquo; session that brought together small groups of students with myself, the Dean, and Student Affairs every month. It was a great opportunity to get a pulse on what was working well and what needed more attention.<br />
 <br />
 <strong>Q: What excites you most about AUC?</strong><br />
 <br />
 A: I&rsquo;m struck by AUC&rsquo;s culture&mdash;it&rsquo;s such a close knit family. Having that sense of community is very important for me.<br />
 <br />
 <strong>Q: When you&rsquo;re not on campus, what do you like to do?</strong><br />
 <br />
 A: I love the beach, snorkeling, and good food. I&rsquo;ve sampled the food at St. Maarten and I&rsquo;m pretty excited to explore more of the culinary delights.&nbsp;<br />
 <br />
 <strong>Q: Are you going to miss the animals at RUSVM?</strong><br />
 <br />
 A: Of course. It&rsquo;s going to be different but I&rsquo;ll also be reminded of the veterinary school which has been my home for nine years. The veterinary students always say that real doctors treat more than one species&mdash;I&rsquo;m looking forward to what medical students have to say about that!</td>

 American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) is pleased to announce that Hazarie Ramoutar will join the university as Senior Administrator for Campus Operations in St. Maarten (SXM). A native of Trinidad, Mr. Ramoutar has spent the past 15 years in operations and organizational management across the Caribbean, including his recent position as Director of the Student Experience at Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine (RUSVM) in St. Kitts.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Mr. Ramoutar comes to AUC with extensive experience in leading roles for organizations of more than 150 employees. During his nine years with RUSVM, Mr. Ramoutar held the positions of Director of the Student Experience and Campus Administrator. As the Director of the Student Experience he oversaw all matters relating to student life, including Student Services, Housing, Student Success Center, Financial Aid, Bursar, Counselling Services, Student Engagement &amp; Professional Standards, and the Health Services departments. He initiated numerous programs and operations across RUSVM that cultivated strong relationships with the student body, administration and faculty, and the government of St. Kitts and Nevis. Under his operational leadership as Campus Administrator in 2011, RUSVM was the first Caribbean veterinary school to receive accreditation from the American Veterinary Medical Association.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;The addition of Mr. Ramoutar to the St. Maarten campus leadership team will enable AUC to strengthen and advance our local operations and our student, faculty, and staff programs,&rdquo; said William Owen, MD, FACP, Dean of Medical Sciences at AUC. &ldquo;He brings a level of excellence and accomplishment from his preceding positions that will benefit our entire community.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Heidi Chumley, MD, Executive Dean and Chief Academic Officer at AUC said, &ldquo;Mr. Ramoutar has proven himself to be an exceptional leader in campus operations. We deeply admire his work with Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine, and our St. Maarten Campus is fortunate that his talents will further support our strong educational environment.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 In his new role as Senior Administrator for Campus Operations in SXM, Mr. Ramoutar will work closely with the campus dean and local operational departments to build on AUC&rsquo;s tradition of delivering an outstanding academic experience. Mr. Ramoutar will also draw on his operational background to identify opportunities that can drive student success and innovation, while reinforcing AUC&rsquo;s culture of care.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Prior to RUSVM, Mr. Ramoutar served as operations and general manager for Bryden and Partners in St. Lucia and group management accountant at S.L. Horsford &amp; Co. LTD in St. Kitts. He received his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in management from the University of the West Indies in Trinidad and is in the process of completing his master&rsquo;s in business administration from the University of Bradford. He is also a chartered accountant.<br />

 Mr. Ramoutar will officially begin with AUC on February 20, 2017. He will report directly to Dr. Owen and will have an office in the business area of Building 1. His wife, Ria Ramoutar, will join him in St. Maarten.&nbsp;</p>

Dean Heidi Chumley Weighs in on the New MCAT in MedPage Today
]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>
 In an opinion editorial published in <em>MedPage Today</em>, Dean Heidi Chumley, MD, discusses preliminary takeaways from the new Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT), which was revamped in 2015. Her article focuses on 5 key observations from the <a href="https://www.aamc.org/download/462316/data/2017mcatguide.pdf">AAMC&rsquo;s 2017 MCAT guide</a>, including:&nbsp;</p>
 <p>
 1. Receiving an above-average MCAT score demonstrates academic preparedness for medical school. Yet, allopathic schools seem to be looking at individuals in the 75th percentile range or above&mdash;which means a 501-506 doesn&rsquo;t necessarily translate to interviews.</p>
 <p>
 2. The AAMC has encouraged medical schools to broaden their threshold of accepted MCAT scores. However, recent findings show that little has changed in schools&rsquo; admissions standards.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>
 3. With little data available about the new MCAT, more applicants with below-median MCAT scores applied to medical school in 2016. This year, applicants will have more MCAT admissions data to contextualize their scores and determine their chances of acceptance.</p>
 <p>

 <p>
 4. Considerably more US medical schools are only accepting the new MCAT for the 2018 admission cycle. This means fewer applicants with the old MCAT&mdash;even with strong scores&mdash;will be considered.</p>
 <p>
 5. The move to the new MCAT is nearly complete, however, we won&rsquo;t know its impact on medical students&rsquo; USMLE step scores or specialty choice for several years.</p>

 The event, held in the university&rsquo;s dry laboratory, included remarks by Executive Dean Heidi Chumley, MD, and Board of Trustees Chairwoman Carol Herbert, MD. In front of Board members, administrative leaders, colleagues, and anatomy teaching assistants, a ribbon&mdash;signed with messages from colleagues and students&mdash;was cut to officially unveil the laboratory&rsquo;s name: <em>The Professor Lance Nash Anatomy Laboratory</em>.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;Professor Nash&rsquo;s passion for medicine, his dedication to serving others, and his quest to continuing learning will live on through this building,&rdquo; said Dr. Herbert. &ldquo;The Board of Trustees is honored to name the laboratory after Dr. Nash and we look forward to sharing his legacy with countless of future medical students.&rdquo;</p>

 <p>
 Dr. Nash&rsquo;s career with AUC spanned 11 years. He served as Professor of Anatomy for the majority of his time and recently chaired the Anatomy Department. He also oversaw the anatomy teaching assistant program, which gave upperclassmen the opportunity to guide and mentor new students through course exercises and dissections. Prior to joining AUC, Dr. Nash practiced as a clinical orthoptist in New Zealand and conducted extensive research on plastination and confocal microscopy.</p>

 In 2012, AUC broke ground on a major campus expansion project, including the construction of a new anatomy laboratory. Dr. Nash created a vision for the laboratory and guided its development throughout the entire process.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s entirely appropriate that the laboratory is named after Dr. Nash,&rdquo; said Phillip Pearson, Associate Professor of Anatomy. &ldquo;After all, he is the one who conceived it, planned it, and saw it through to the opening. He was a man who truly gave so much to AUC, and now we can give this back to him.&rdquo;</p>

AUC and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center Extend Medical Student Education Agreement
]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>
 American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) and <a href="https://www.bronxcare.org/">Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center</a> (Bronx-Lebanon) have signed a 10-year affiliation agreement to enable AUC medical students to complete clinical training in the hospital. This agreement builds on a six-year collaboration that has enabled more than 1,000 AUC students to train at Bronx-Lebanon, the largest voluntary not-for-profit healthcare system serving the South and Central Bronx areas of New York. &nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;Bronx-Lebanon provides critically-needed care for an ethnically diverse and medically-underserved patient population. Students who rotate there develop clinical skills while being exposed to how socioeconomic conditions and situations impact patients&rsquo; health,&rdquo; said Heidi Chumley, M.D., executive dean and chief academic officer at AUC. &ldquo;This is an excellent training opportunity for our students, and a major component of the pipeline of new doctors to address New York&rsquo;s physician shortage.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Through the agreement, each year 48 AUC students will be able to complete 48 weeks of core clinical rotations with Bronx-Lebanon&rsquo;s departments of family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, obstetrics/gynecology, and psychiatry. Another 52 elective rotations will be available each year of the agreement. Under the supervision of Bronx-Lebanon physicians and residents, AUC students will take patient histories, conduct physical examinations, present cases and assist with medical procedures.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 As part of the agreement, AUC will provide financial and technical support for the development of an onsite medical simulation center. The center will include six exam bays, adult and adolescent simulation rooms, and a learning facility&mdash;all of which will be available to rotating medical students.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 AUC has clinical training affiliations with 21 U.S. hospitals and health systems, and Bronx-Lebanon is the university&rsquo;s largest. In 2016, 268 AUC students trained at the hospital. Nearly 200 AUC graduates currently practice in the state of New York.</p>

American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine Releases 2016 Residency Report
]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<h3>
 <em>Graduates Attained Residencies at Higher Rates than Osteopathic Medical Graduates </em><em>and International Medical Graduates</em></h3>
 <p>
 &nbsp;<br />
 <strong>CORAL GABLES, FL (October 27, 2016)</strong> &ndash; American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) today r
]]>
<![CDATA[
eleased its annual residency placement report, which charts 2015-16 graduates&rsquo; residency attainment, including performance in the Main Residency Match&reg;. That system, used by allopathic, osteopathic, and international medical school graduates, placed nearly 30,000 physicians into residency positions across the United States.&nbsp;<br />
 <br />
 For the fourth consecutive year, AUC saw an increase in graduates&rsquo; residency attainment. At 86.4% in 2016, AUC&rsquo;s attainment rate not only surpassed US citizen international medical graduates (53.9%) and non-US citizen international medical graduates (50.5%), but also osteopathic medical school graduates (80.3%). It was also the school&rsquo;s strongest first-time match rate since 2012. &nbsp;<br />
 <br />
 <u>Other Key Findings</u>:</p>
 <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
 <li>
 <div>
 AUC&rsquo;s residency attainment rate increased two full percentage points from last year&rsquo;s rate of 84.3% and three percentage points from 2014&rsquo;s rate of 83.3%.</div>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
 <li>
 The majority of AUC graduates entered primary care, including internal medicine (76), family medicine (63) and pediatrics (27). In total, AUC graduates secured PGY-1 and PGY-2 positions in 29 specialties at 209 unique programs.</li>
 </ul>
 <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
 <li>
 <div>
 In 2016, AUC graduates earned PGY-1 &amp; 2 residencies in 37 states across the US. The most notable include New York (55 positions), Michigan (33), Florida (19), New Jersey (15), California (11), and Texas (11).</div>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
 <li>
 <div>
 Nearly one in three graduates are returning to their home state for residency. For students who want to serve patients in their hometown communities, AUC provides that opportunity.</div>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
 <li>
 <div>
 97 percent of 2014-2015 AUC graduates who passed their United States Medical Licensing Examination&reg; (USMLE) on the first attempt attained a residency position by April 2016.</div>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 The report also looks at AUC&rsquo;s role in addressing the US primary care workforce shortage, which is in current need of 8,200 physicians. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, that shortfall is projected to reach up to 35,600 by 2025.<br />
 <br />
 Schools like AUC, which train primarily US citizens who return home to practice medicine, are critical to filling that gap. This year, more than half (68.2%) of AUC&rsquo;s residency-seeking graduates chose to enter primary care specialties (family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology)&mdash;that&rsquo;s 172 new primary care physicians from AUC alone.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;I am very proud of what our graduates have achieved,&rdquo; said Dr. Heidi Chumley, Executive Dean and Chief Academic Officer of AUC. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m confident that we are continuing to make AUC even better and will be able to sustain and build on these achievements.&rdquo;<br />

<![CDATA[
American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) and the American Red Cross (Red Cross) have established a partnership to provide opportunities for AUC medical students and alumni to contribute to Red Cross programs across the country.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The academic service learning
]]>
<![CDATA[
agreement mirrors past organized efforts between AUC and the Red Cross in cities such as New York, Detroit, Los Angeles and Miami, as well in St. Maarten where the medical school&rsquo;s campus is located. The agreement paves the way for AUC to help support Red Cross chapters through coordinated community initiatives.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;This expanded relationship with the Red Cross supports our institution&rsquo;s focus on educating physicians who are socially accountable and engaged citizens,&rdquo; said Dr. Heidi Chumley, executive dean and chief academic officer of AUC. &ldquo;Community service is an important part of AUC&rsquo;s culture and this partnership provides students with opportunities to remain engaged with communities as they complete training in the U.S.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delighted to support AUC&rsquo;s commitment to foster community health by engaging their medical students in academic service learning and alumni as Red Cross volunteers,&rdquo; said Linda MacIntyre, chief nurse for the American Red Cross. &ldquo;This is a great way to leverage the work of our organizations to better serve communities and families.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The program will be piloted with the Red Cross&rsquo; Greater Miami and the Keys Chapter, which provides essential aid to a diverse set of communities with unique health and safety challenges. The chapter serves nearly two million Florida residents. AUC students and alumni will be able to participate in the chapter&rsquo;s priority initiatives, including:<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Case management for families displaced by natural disasters or fires<br />
 &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emergency preparedness training for local businesses, schools and organizations<br />
 &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire prevention education and services, such as smoke detector installation<br />
 &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CPR training for local businesses, schools and organizations<br />
 &middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Support services for family members of the armed services<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 In conjunction with the announcement, AUC and the Red Cross will host a home fire prevention event Saturday, Oct. 22, in Miami. Volunteers will go door to door to check or install smoke alarms, and help families create emergency check lists and escape plans.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;Having AUC as part of the Red Cross team is outstanding. Their culture of community service fits clearly with our mission and we are excited this new relationship is beginning at our Greater Miami and Keys Chapter,&rdquo; said Alfred Sanchez, Regional CEO of the Red Cross&rsquo; South Florida Region.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The new partnership builds on AUC&rsquo;s portfolio of service learning and community affairs initiatives. AUC has supported numerous programs and organizations, including the St. Maarten Ministry of Public Health and the St. Maarten chapter of the Red Cross, to bring increased health awareness and access to preventive health services to the local community.&nbsp;<br />

aribbean School of Medicine (AUC), play a crucial role in helping to fill this gap.&nbsp;<br />
 <br />
 In an opinion piece in&nbsp;<em>The Buffalo News</em>, Dr. Chumley discusses the valuable contributions of schools like AUC that train primarily US citizens who return home to practice medicine. Large numbers of AUC graduates choose to enter primary care specialties that are desperately needed in New York and throughout the United States.<br />
 <br />
 In 2016, for example, AUC placed 69 graduates across New York state -- 46 in primary care. With less than half (42 percent) of New York&#39;s medical students choosing to stay and practice in the state, AUC-trained physicians are satisfying the healthcare needs of patients in the state.<br />

: rgb(255, 255, 255); float: right;" title="Headshot_sized.jpg" />It is with great sorrow that I write to you. American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) suffered a profound loss yesterday. Dr. Lance Nash, Professor of Anatomy and Chair of the Anatomy Department, passed away peace

<![CDATA[
fully at his home.<br />
 <br />
 Dr. Nash was a dedicated educator, researcher, mentor and friend. He spent more than a decade with AUC, leading the Anatomy Department and fostering a strong intellectual curiosity in all of his students.<br />
 <br />
 Before joining AUC, Dr. Nash spent many years as a health care professional in the field of Orthotics and Prosthetics, rising to the rank of Regional Manager for Wellington Capital Health. For more than decade, he practiced as a Clinical Orthotist in major New Zealand hospitals, working with medical and other paramedical professionals in numerous in-patient and out-patient clinics, especially in orthopaedics.<br />
 <br />
 Dr. Nash earned a B.A. in Biological Anthropology and Developmental Psychology at Auckland University, and then completed graduate courses in Child Development and Counselling at Victoria University. After taking this range of courses, it was Anatomy, and gross Anatomy in particular, that really captured his interest. Hence, after completing a Bachelor&rsquo;s and Master&rsquo;s degree at Otago University School of Medicine, Dr. Nash entered the Ph.D. program.<br />
 <br />
 His research focused on plastination and confocal microscopy, which are used to examine the morphology and topography of the deep fascia of the head and neck.&nbsp;Dr. Nash&rsquo;s interest and experience in generating new anatomical knowledge of clinical relevance enriched lectures and helped students understand the role of research in providing new insights of fundamental importance in Anatomy. This passion for teaching and his commitment to this community were evident in everything that he did.<br />
 <br />
 Dr. Nash&rsquo;s passing is a tremendous loss to our entire community&mdash;from those in St. Maarten to those off of the island who had trained and worked alongside him. Though originally from New Zealand, Dr. Nash had truly become a St. Maarten local, deeply involved with organizations like the Rotary Club.<br />
 <br />
 AUC expresses our deepest condolences to Dr. Nash&rsquo;s family, friends, and students. We were all honored and privileged to have known him. He will not soon be forgotten.<br />
 <br />
 Sincerely,<br />

 <br />
 Dr. Golden Jackson, Assistant Dean for Service Learning and Community Affairs, presided over the ceremony, which included performances by Generation New Status Drum Corps and addresses by St. Maarten Governor Eugene B. Holiday, AUC Executive Dean and Chief Academic Officer Dr. Heidi Chumley, and 2003 alumni and Fast Track Urgent Care Corporate Medical Director <a href="http://www.aucmed.edu/news-and-events/news/alumni-paul-nanda,-md,-to-speak-at-auc-s-2016-grad.aspx">Dr. Paul Nanda</a>.</p>
 <h2>
 <strong>Prepared for Evolving Health Issues</strong></h2>
 <img alt="Nanda-Chumley-sized-(1).jpg" src="~/getattachment/news-and-events/news/2016-Commencement-Summary/Nanda-Chumley-sized-(1).jpg.aspx" style="border: 10px solid rgb(255, 255, 255); float: right;" title="Nanda-Chumley-sized-(1).jpg" />
 <div>
 <p>
 <br />
 This year&rsquo;s Commencement concentrated on physicians&rsquo; growing societal responsibilities, and the sophisticated views and experiences that AUC-trained physicians possess.<br />
 <br />
 In his keynote speech, Dr. Nanda described how opportunities at AUC shaped a world view on global health disparities. Upon completing rotations in the United Kingdom, he began to understand how different healthcare models and systems impact communities and care&mdash;an interest that led him to pursue numerous global health endeavors in sub-Saharan Africa, Belize, Honduras, Brazil, Peru, Haiti, New Zealand and Northern India. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;I believe that AUC students are educated with a broad, problem-based learning background and structure that further prepares them to move the system forward,&rdquo; said Dr. Nanda. &ldquo;AUC students who choose to work or volunteer overseas at some point in their career are further qualified and uniquely positioned to participate in discussions about healthcare in the United States.&rdquo;</p>
 <h2>
 <strong>Continuing a Path of Care and Compassion</strong></h2>
 <p>
 <br />
 Drawing from her background as a family physician, Dr. Chumley encouraged graduates to direct their new-found influence as physicians in meaningful ways.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;There is a power that comes with being a physician, and today I want to encourage you to use that power,&rdquo; said Dr. Chumley. &ldquo;Realize that you have an enormous opportunity to positively impact your patients&rsquo; life. Remember that passion and compassion that you embodied here at medical school and know that you have the power to make a difference.&rdquo;</p>
 <h2>
 <strong>Recognizing Academic Excellence and Service</strong></h2>
 <p>
 <br />
 <img alt="IMG_4952-sized-(1).jpg" src="~/getattachment/news-and-events/news/2016-Commencement-Summary/IMG_4952-sized-(1).jpg.aspx" style="width: 250px; height: 311px; border: 10px solid rgb(255, 255, 255); float: left;" title="IMG_4952-sized-(1).jpg" />Two inaugural awards were presented during the morning and afternoon ceremonies. Dr. Kevin Kresofsky received the <em>Outstanding Academic Achievement Award</em>, which honors an exemplary commitment to the study of medicine and academic excellence while at AUC. Dr.&nbsp;Kresofsky will begin his general surgery residency this July at Nassau University Medical Center in New York.<br />
 <br />
 Dr. Adetoun Adeyemi and Dr. Vicken Zeitjian each received the <em>Excellence in Community and University Service Award</em>, which recognizes students&#39; service to AUC, St. Maarten, and the clinical communities. Dr. Adeyemi will begin her internal medicine residency at Morehouse School of Medicine in Georgia and Dr. Zeitjian will begin his internal medicine residency at Maricopa Medical Center in Arizona. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <h2>
 <strong>Entering the Medical Profession</strong></h2>
 <p>
 <br />
 Class of 2016 graduates join a network of more than 5,000 AUC alumni around the world. Many will now prepare for residency training in a variety of specialties, including internal medicine, pediatrics, neurology, general surgery, radiology, family medicine and more.</p>

ding AUC, he took advantage of the <a href="~/academics/clinical-sciences/the-uk-clinical-experience.aspx">clinical training program in the United Kingdom</a> and completed core rotations in London. He then completed his family medicine residency at The Ohio State University and received three of eight awards within the Department of Family Medicine, including the Dr. Tennyson Williams Outstanding Resident Award and the Dr. Bryan Beggin Community Service Award. Dr. Nanda became one of the school&rsquo;s first family medicine residents to complete an international rotation&mdash;ultimately shaping his next role as OSU&rsquo;s Director of Global Health Education for the Department of Family Medicine.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Dr. Nanda&rsquo;s personal global health contributions are significant and numerous, including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis care to patients in Sub-Saharan Africa; medical rescue courses in the remote jungles of Belize; disaster relief services following the earthquake in Haiti; urgent care in low socioeconomic areas of New Zealand; and leading a team of 45 medical students on a month-long mission trip to remote Northern India. &nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Now, as Medical Director of Fast Track Urgent Care, he oversees five physician-owned clinics serving more than 40,000 patients annually across urban and suburban regions of Tampa Bay.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 AUC will hold two commencement ceremonies on Saturday, May 28: at 9:30 a.m. EDT and at 2:30 p.m. EDT. Events will take place at the Sonesta Maho Beach Resort in St. Maarten.</p>

<p>
 New research published in the <em><a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1511707?query=TOC">New England Journal of Medicine</a></em> finds that the number of available residency slots in the US far-exceeds the number of medical school graduates, and will continue to do so for years

to come.<br />
 <br />
 The analysis dispels previous rumors of a &quot;residency cliff,&quot; and is an important finding for international medical school students, especially those from the US who seek to complete their residency training in the states.&nbsp;<br />
 <br />
 While researchers note that the number of medical school graduates has begun to catch up with the number of available residency slots, that the gap is narrowing very slowly.&nbsp;In fact, in 2024, the number of available residency positions will exceed graduates by around 4,500.<br />
 <br />
 This year, graduates <a href="~/alumni/residency-placement/2016-residency-placements.aspx">earned competitive residencies</a>&nbsp;throughout the US&nbsp;in anesthesiology, emergency medicine, family medicine, internal medicine, surgery, neurology, obstetrics-gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, and radiology among other specialties. We are also proud of those AUC graduates who not only secure a residency, but become&nbsp;<a href="~/blog/may-2016/find-out-which-auc-grads-are-2016-2017-chief-resid.aspx">chief resident</a>&nbsp;in their program-- an added responsibility reserved for physicians with strong leadership and clinical skills.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>
 Dr. Heidi Chumley, Executive Dean and Chief Academic Officer of AUC, discusses the new residency research in <em>KevinMD</em> and the valuable role of international medical school graduates in filling the U.S. physician shortage.&nbsp;<br />

Students leaving the campus to fulfill clerkships in the United States, United Kingdom, or Canada can use the app to access their schedules, connect with clinical advisors, and retrieve patient encounter and procedure forms.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The new offering is part of an ongoing effort by AUC and DeVry Medical International to provide students with enhanced technological services and systems. By integrating students&rsquo; AUC profiles with academic resources and clerkship materials, AUC has made significant progress toward realizing this vision and streamlining information for students.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Throughout the year, AUC will gather student feedback to guide future iterations and updates to the app.<br />

Why Paying Hospitals for Clerkships is Good, and Necessary: Dean Chumley's Editorial in KevinMD.com
]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>
 In April 2016, highly regarded healthcare website KevinMD.com published an editorial by Heidi Chumley, MD, executive dean and chief academic officer at American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC). The editorial provides an important perspective on clinical training, which is an essential part of medical education. As students progress to their third and fourth years of medical school, clinical rotations at hospitals and other healthcare settings provide valuable hands-on experience with patients, interdisciplinary teams, and various medical conditions. Dean Chumley&#39;s editorial makes a strong case for compensating hospitals for the important service of teaching and mentoring medical students at a critical stage in their learning, when they are learning how to provide patient care and preparing to enter residency.&nbsp;<br />
 <br />
 <strong>READ:</strong> <strong><a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2016/04/why-paying-hospitals-for-clerkships-is-good-and-necessary.html" target="_blank">Why Paying Hospitals for Clerkships is Good - and Necessary</a></strong><br />
 <br />
 AUC has a network of <a href="~/academics/clinical-sciences/hospital-teaching-sites.aspx">US and UK teaching hospitals</a>&nbsp;where students complete their core clerkships and electives. These sites provide clerkship directors who devote time to overseeing students&#39; clinical experience, organizing and giving lectures, and managing student evaluations in addition to other responsibilities that require significant resources and planning. Many teaching programs&nbsp;face resource challenges. As Dean Chumley points out at KevinMD.com, clinical affiliation agreements between AUC and partner hospitals can provide funds to support needs such as clerkship director service,&nbsp;expanded residency programs, facility renovations, technology upgrades such as simulation labs, and improved learning spaces -- which benefit not only the hospitals but also the students and residents training there.<br />

s arrived at Ruby Labega Primary School on Monday, March 21, 2016, their school looked completely different. New sidewalks, fences, gardens, and a freshly painted basketball court adorned the school&rsquo;s grounds after a weekend clean-up effort by more than 65 American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) faculty and staff members, and their families.<br />
 <br />
 The volunteer effort is part of AUC&rsquo;s commitment to community service, which includes student-driven Community Action Days, local health fairs, the annual Lions Fair, and screening events among others. Saturday&rsquo;s project signified one of the first faculty and staff volunteer events&mdash;an initiative the school hopes to continue annually.<br />
 <br />
 AUC selected Ruby Labega after touring the island to find schools in need of repairs. Gerard Lake, AUC&rsquo;s safety and security manager, helped to select the school after talking with the principal, Ms. Jeffers. She described neglected recreational spaces, much-needed grounds maintenance, and a broken fence from which children were sneaking away from school premises.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 What started as a small service project of seven quickly grew and on Saturday, March 19, 2016, more than five dozen AUC volunteers showed up. Participants, including Ruby Labega&rsquo;s assistant principal, Ms. Augustina, built a new pathway, planted a garden, installed a new mesh fence, repainted the basketball court, raked leaves and even trimmed the grass.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;Working alongside colleagues and for such an important cause was a fulfilling experience,&rdquo; said Golden Jackson, PhD, assistant dean for service learning and community affairs at AUC. &ldquo;The result was a beautiful addition to the school that will benefit students for quite some time.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />
 Officials from AUC are looking to expand collaborations like the one with Ruby Labega in the future.&nbsp;<br />

New York State Board of Regents Grants Long-Term Clerkships for AUC Students
]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
The New York State Board of Regents has approved American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) for long-term clinical clerkships throughout the state. The authorization enables AUC to continue placing capable medical students in New York clinical settings through 2022.
 <p>
 &ldquo;Clinical opportunities are a formidable part of students&rsquo; medical education. The State Board of Regents&rsquo; decision upholds AUC&rsquo;s tradition of offering students with challenging and prestigious clerkships in one of the country&rsquo;s most culturally diverse states,&rdquo; said <a href="~/academics/faculty-and-staff/dr-chumley.aspx">Heidi Chumley</a>, MD, AUC executive dean and chief academic officer. &ldquo;We are pleased with the Board&rsquo;s decision and proud to provide students with quality educational opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 The New York State Board of Regents supervises all educational activities within the state and presides over the State Department of Education (SED). Advised by a Committee on Long-Term Clinical Clerkships, the Board oversees applications by international medical schools to place students in clinical rotations at New York hospitals.</p>
 <p>
 The approval by the SED ensures that third and fourth year AUC students are able to participate in <a href="~/academics/clinical-sciences/hospital-teaching-sites.aspx">clinical rotations</a> in New York.</p>

Collaboration with Sint Maarten Ministry Brings Opportunities for AUC Medical Students
]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[
<img alt="web-AUC-collaboration-agreement-signing-(1).jpg" src="~/getattachment/a2ef02e7-3efc-4ac0-8d40-468a56bcad44/web-AUC-collaboration-agreement-signing-(1).jpg.aspx" style="padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px; float: right;" title="web-AUC-collaboration-agreement-signing-(1).jpg" />American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) has signed an agreement with the Sint Maarten Ministry of Public Health, Social Development, and Labor to collaborate on initiatives to address the country&rsquo;s public health needs.<br />
 <p>
 The agreement, signed in Sint Maarten on February 11, creates a platform for AUC students to engage in service-learning opportunities that have a direct impact on the Ministry&rsquo;s health policies and activities.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;AUC is proud to join the Ministry in developing programs to support public health research that can be used to inform the Ministry&rsquo;s efforts on behalf of the citizens of Sint Maarten. This mutually beneficial partnership provides our physicians-in-training with the opportunity for meaningful volunteer experiences that are focused on the needs of the community,&rdquo; said Heidi Chumley, MD, AUC executive dean and chief executive officer.</p>
 <p>
 AUC has also pledged to work with the Ministry to create medical education programs and preceptorships to help enhance the capacity of Sint Maarten&rsquo;s healthcare workforce.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;The shared vision of this platform allows for a win-win situation for both parties by enhancing the education of AUC medical students and providing resources and medical expertise to the Ministry. One of the main projects is a chronic disease prevention program utilizing the mobile health bus. With health care costs on the rise worldwide, prevention programs are a proven means of reducing the burden of these diseases for a population. AUC will provide dedicated volunteers, students, and faculty to assist with the execution of the program,&rdquo; said Minister Emil Lee in a statement.</p>
 <p>
 The new collaboration agreement builds on previous work undertaken together by AUC faculty and students and the Ministry, Sint Maarten healthcare professionals, and community organizations. Through projects like <a href="~/news-and-events/news/students-serve-local-community-through-project-hel.aspx">Project HELP</a> and <a href="~/blog/october-2015/check-out-highlights-from-october-s-community-acti.aspx">Community Action Day</a>, AUC has developed numerous opportunities for students to contribute to local projects while gaining firsthand experience in providing medical assistance and preventive screening for the local population.</p>

 <br />
 <span style="line-height: 20px;">Stan Baldwin, PhD, Dean<br />
 School of Science and Mathematics Mississippi College</span></span></span> The impetus for the new relationship between the two institutions was the volume of MC&rsquo;s M.S. in Biology (Medical Sciences) graduates who were applying to and were accepted to AUC.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;We began to notice a consistent stream of interest from graduates of MC&rsquo;s M.S. in Biology program,&rdquo; said Tiffany Ciolek, director of Admissions at AUC. Currently, there are 15 MC in Biology (Medical Sciences) graduates who are enrolled at AUC.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;As we delved deeper, we learned that nearly all of AUC students who were graduates of MC&rsquo;s M.S. in Biology program were demonstrating a solid academic performance. It made sense to establish a direct pathway for future graduates who wanted to pursue a medical education at AUC,&rdquo; said Ciolek.</p>
 <br />
 <h2>
 A Shared Value of Community Makes for a Good Relationship</h2>
 <p>
 According to Heidi Chumley, MD, executive dean and chief academic officer at AUC, graduates of MC&rsquo;s M.S. in Biology (Medical Sciences) program can point to several factors that may have contributed to their accomplishments at AUC, in particularly the school&rsquo;s individualized approach to teaching and mentoring of medical students. &ldquo;AUC&rsquo;s collaborative, empathetic, and team-based approach to medicine seems to meet our students&rsquo; expectations that were established while attending school at Mississippi College &ndash; which is one of the reasons this new relationship is a good fit for both institutions.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;When I visited the AUC campus, it was evident that the faculty were passionate and dedicated to quality instruction and student progress. When you factor in the AUC experience and our graduates training in courses like Human Gross Anatomy, Physiology, Histology, Neuroanatomy and Pharmacology, graduates of the M.S. in Biology (Medical Sciences) program are positioned to do well at AUC,&rdquo; said Stan Baldwin, dean of the School of Science and Mathematics at MC, who played an integral role in establishing the agreement between the two institutions. &ldquo;Also, I thought the classrooms, testing center and simulation labs were extremely advanced at AUC. They were as well-equipped as any US medical school that I&rsquo;ve seen.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 &nbsp;</p>
 <h2>
 Students Get a Solid Foundation for a Career in Medicine</h2>
 <p>
 According to MC, the M.S. in Biology (Medical Sciences) program is designed to prepare students for a career in medical sciences research or those wishing to enter medical school, among other fields. Since the curriculum is modeled after a medical school education, the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) allows MC to offer the subject board exams to their students, covering Human Gross Anatomy, Physiology, Histology, Neuroanatomy and Pharmacology. These are the same board exams typically taken by medical students during their first two years. Last year the top score of a MC student on the Gross Anatomy board was in the 99 percentile.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Getting a master&rsquo;s degree in Medical Sciences at Mississippi College allowed me to acquaint myself with the course load demanded in a professional level program,&rdquo; said AUC alumnus Aaron DeWitt, MD, who is completing an Internal Medicine Residency at Baton Rouge General Hospital. DeWitt is one of three AUC alumni who graduated from MC&rsquo;s M.S. in Biology (Medical Sciences) who are currently completing family medicine and internal medicine residency programs in Louisiana, Florida and Georgia.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;AUC provided me with the knowledge base to become a clinician,&rdquo; said DeWitt. &ldquo;AUC more than provided me with all of the tools needed for intern year. I would recommend AUC to Mississippi College grads.&rdquo;</p>

 Members of the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine&rsquo;s (AUC) Latino Medical Student Association (LMSA)&mdash;one of AUC&#39;s many <a href="http
]]>
<![CDATA[
://www.aucmed.edu/about/student-life/clubs-and-organizations.aspx">student organizations and clubs</a>&mdash;organized, funded, and completed a medical service mission trip to La Antigua, Guatemala last spring. For many participants, it was a life-changing experience that affirmed their commitment to providing medical care to disadvantaged communities.<br />
 <br />
 The 12 students, along with two physicians, raised money for and provided much-needed items such as toothpaste, vitamins, supplements, antibiotics, antihistamines, painkillers, antiparasitics, and other essential medications to local residents. In addition, the students worked alongside local doctors to provide free healthcare screenings for people of all ages ranging from young children to older adults.</p>
 <h2>
 How This Medical Mission Trip Was an Eye-Opening Experience</h2>
 <p>
 Paula Lopez, LMSA vice president, says that the trip taught her to make the most of what you have. &ldquo;After going abroad to Guatemala, I came to understand that no matter how hard one tries, it is really difficult to find a solution for everyone, but what one can do is to make the best use out of the resources available.&rdquo; She adds that the gratitude the students received &ldquo;was very rewarding.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Kathryn Majdick, one of the principal organizers of the trip, was moved by her experience serving as a translator and member of a small group of students who, along with a Guatemalan physician, interviewed, diagnosed and treated residents of a small village outside La Antigua.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;We had to cross a river and traverse many dirt roads to get there,&rdquo; she recalls. &ldquo;It was easy to see that the people had few resources, but they had a church, a soccer field and a schoolhouse&hellip; Each patient was incredibly patient, waiting over and hour to see us, and being constantly interrupted as our local doctor taught us to perform important physical exam procedures and recognize signs and symptoms. They were all incredibly gracious and appreciative. I felt immediately re-inspired.&rdquo;</p>
 <h2>
 An Emotional Reminder of Why We Practice Medicine</h2>
 <p>
 One patient left a lasting impression on Majdick. A 68-year-old woman had many serious health conditions, including uncontrolled diabetes, gastrointestinal problems, and low blood pressure. &ldquo;She was not able to get her medications due to lack of funds, access to a pharmacy, and any kind of routine care. As we discussed her symptoms, she began to cry. She told me &lsquo;<em>estoy suffriendo,&rsquo;</em> which means &lsquo;I am suffering.&rsquo; She said she was lucky to eat a tortilla every day, and shared that she does not eat vegetables or fruit or protein.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Majdick recalls feeling hopeless. She offered her hand to the woman and advised her to go the hospital for care, but thought she was unlikely to go. &ldquo;We realized the limitations of our impact as well as the lack of sufficient care in this region.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Reflecting upon this memory makes Majdick tearful, she says, because it serves as a reminder of why she is studying medicine and of her passion for community service.</p>
 <h2>
 More About the Latino Medical Student Association</h2>
 <p>
 The LMSA unites and empowers medical students through service, mentorship and education to advocate for the health of disadvantaged communities.</p>
 <p>
 In addition to running the service mission to Guatemala, the organization&rsquo;s 50 members have raised funds for an orphanage on St. Maarten, provided Medical Spanish classes to students interested in working with Spanish-speaking patients and communities, and delivered free medical examinations including blood pressure screenings, visual acuity tests, eye examinations, weight and height measures, and individual counseling about healthy lifestyles at a Community Action Day held at St. Martin of Tours Church. The association also holds potlucks to reunite students and share ideas and general meetings to inform members of projects for each semester.</p>
 <p>
 Last summer LMSA, in conjunction with AUC&rsquo;s Black Medical Student Association, hosted a talent show fundraiser for the St. Maarten Sickle Cell Foundation. The sold-out event resulted in a $1,200 donation.</p>
 <p>
 Blanca Gomez-Castillo, LMSA president, invites students to join the club. She says that her leadership position has given her more confidence and provided opportunities to hone her social, organizational and leadership skills. She adds that it is helping to prepare her to multitask in the future, and maintain her commitment to devoting at least some of her time to serving disadvantaged communities.</p>

AUC students present innovative research on the complications of pregnancy and childbirth at international conference

<description>

 In June, Alexander Vanderby and Rachel Stamatis, two students from American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) presented their research at the prestigious World Congress in Fetal Medicine in Crete, Greece, joining leading international experts and other young researchers in t

<![CDATA[
The posters focused on four patients who received treatment at Epsom General Hospital in Epsom, Surrey, England, where Vanderby and Stamatis are completing their clinical rotations. They combined case presentations with literature reviews and recommended new approaches to managing or diagnosing potentially fatal complications of pregnancy and childbirth.</p>
 <p>
 One poster focused on a condition called congenital diaphragmatic hernia, in which a hole in a developing fetus&rsquo; diaphragm allows the abdominal organs to move into the chest, preventing the lungs from developing normally and resulting in severe respiratory distress. &ldquo;Usually this is a defect is seen on an ultrasound before the baby is born so the team can be prepared,&rdquo; explains Vanderby. &ldquo;Our hospital delivered a baby that suffered from this condition, but it was not visible before the baby was born.&rdquo; The poster described the current guidelines, discussed how hospitals can better prepare to treat newborns with the condition, explored innovative treatment techniques, and advocated for specialized training to handle emergencies.</p>
 <p>
 <img alt="IMG_3462.jpg" src="~/getattachment/news-and-events/news/Two-AUC-students-conducted-clerkships-and-research/IMG_3462.jpg.aspx?width=260&amp;height=195" style="border-width: 1px; border-style: solid; width: 260px; height: 195px; float: right; margin: 2px;" title="IMG_3462.jpg" /></p>
 <div>
 A second poster featured a twin pregnancy with a single shared placenta, in which only one twin survived. Vanderby and Stamatis investigated whether the other twin&rsquo;s death may have been preventable by looking at the literature available for placenta classification and the possibility of anatomical anomalies.</div>
 <div>
 <p>
 A third poster focused on preeclampsia, a life-threatening pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and signs of damage to another organ system, often the kidneys, says Stamatis, who is applying for an Ob/Gyn residency this fall. She and Vanderby looked at the possibility of saving mothers&rsquo; and infants&rsquo; lives by detecting preeclampsia during the first trimester, instead of the third trimester, by using innovative new tests that are superior to those being used in current practice.</p>
 <div>
 &nbsp;</div>
 <p>
 The fourth poster explored another serious pregnancy condition known as placenta accrete, which occurs when blood vessels and other parts of the placenta grow too deeply into the uterine wall, preventing them from smoothly detaching at birth. Women with this condition usually require a life-saving hysterectomy (removal of womb). The students&rsquo; paper discussed the challenges present even when women receive&nbsp;thorough&nbsp;ultrasounds and MRIs during pregnancy. The students also discussed the risk factors associated with&nbsp;Cesarean sections for developing this disorder.</p>
 <p>
 Both Vanderby and Stamatis were invited to submit research to the conference by Dr. Aliaa Arafa, a consultant and lead clinician for Epsom General Hospital&rsquo;s obstetrics and labor ward. &nbsp;&ldquo;We wanted to become more involved in academic medicine and these projects were the perfect place to start,&rdquo; says Vanderby.</p>
 <p>
 Stamatis adds that although putting off studying to spend weeks researching and writing the papers seemed like more than she could handle at first, she was glad she said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and she valued the experience to present at an international conference attended by more than 2,000 leaders in obstetrics. &ldquo;You never know when someone asks you to do a little thing where that will lead you,&rdquo; she says.</p>
 <p>
 Stamatis worked full-time to pay her way through college, so she wasn&rsquo;t able to pursue the community service and clinical experience required by U.S. medical schools. AUC, she says, gave her a second chance. Vanderby, the son of an AUC alum, came to medicine as a second career, after working for the National Park Service.</p>
 <p>
 Both say they have enjoyed completing their rotations in the UK. &ldquo;Working in England exposed me to the international medical community by allowing me to work alongside doctors from dozens of countries, each with a different background and training,&rdquo; says Vanderby. &ldquo;I have met some amazing physicians here who have been willing to mentor and teach students from AUC.&rdquo; Stamatis echoes these sentiments, adding that she especially appreciates the level of hands-on experience she received, particularly in her Surgical and Ob/Gyn rotations. &ldquo;We are also in a unique position to see the successes and shortcomings of socialized medicine,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I hope to use this to guide me as I become a leader and provider of U.S. health care.&rdquo;</p>

the student body at American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC). This semester, Ronald Testa, PhD, medical sciences dean, presented Bell with the Student Engagement Award in&nbsp;recognition of her dedication and contribution to the &ldquo;family-like&rdquo; campus community and the positive impact she has had on the collaborative culture.</p>
 <div>
 <p>
 Bell&rsquo;s introduction to the close-knit community came during a Faculty Advisor Meet-and-Greet organized by Vivian Braciale, PhD, professor of microbiology and immunology. At this event, Bell connected with other students who matriculated into AUC after completing the <a href="~/admissions/apply-to-auc/merp.aspx" target="_blank">Medical Education Readiness Program</a> (MERP), a 15-week medical school preparatory program offered to students who have been granted conditional acceptance to AUC.<br />
 <br />
 &quot;I knew I wanted to become one of those students; successful, hardworking, but mainly, selfless in providing help to other students,&rdquo; recalls Bell. &ldquo;Since then, I&rsquo;ve tried to make myself available to assist fellow classmates as we navigate the shared journey to becoming physicians.&quot;<br />
 <br />
 &nbsp;Over the course of her medical sciences semesters, Bell held true to this goal by wholeheartedly committing to several student-centered roles on campus. She has served as peer-to-peer tutor, class tutor, president of the Student Government Association, and vice president of the Latino Medical Student Association.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;Esther&rsquo;s effectiveness and dedication as a leader clearly demonstrates her allegiance to AUC,&rdquo; said Golden Jackson, PhD, Assistant Dean for Service-Learning and Community Affairs. &ldquo;She truly understands the spirit and practice of engagement and collaboration.&rdquo;<br />

sson has much to be proud of. He is not only the latest recipient of the Karl Stockhausen Student of the Semester Award and recent inductee into the Alpha Omega Phi Honor and Service Society, but was also recently presented with the <a href="http://www.aucmed.edu/student-services/scholarships/student-engagement-award.aspx">Student Engagement Scholarship</a>.<br />
 <br />
 Ronald Testa, PhD, medical sciences dean, awarded the Student Engagement Scholarship to Nilsson during the May 2015 semester&rsquo;s Dean&rsquo;s List Reception. This scholarship recognizes students whose activities as part of the campus community have helped to enhance and foster the AUC culture of collaboration.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;Nilsson has demonstrated extraordinary commitment to the success of his fellow students as a lead teaching assistant,&rdquo; said William Hayden, MD, EdD, associate professor, behavioral and clinical medicine. &ldquo;He plays a leading role in the Harvey Lab by scheduling group sessions, orienting and training new Harvey teaching assistants and also provides group and peer-to-peer tutoring.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;During my first semester, I took advantage of everything AUC has to offer and got involved with student organizations and community outreach,&rdquo; said Nilsson. &ldquo;At the same time, I learned what it meant to study for countless hours and how tutors can positively impact academic success. By becoming a tutor and TA, I&rsquo;ve come full circle.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />
 In addition to leadership roles in an academic setting, Nilsson is also an active member of several <a href="http://www.aucmed.edu/about/student-life/clubs-and-organizations.aspx">student organizations</a><a href="~/about/student-life/clubs-and-organizations.aspx" target="_blank"> </a>including Phi Chi, a community service fraternity, the American Medical Student Association, and the Latino American Medical Student Association. He also serves as an orientation advisor for incoming students and resident advisors for those living in on-campus apartments.<br />
 <br />
 As Nilsson prepares for the next phase of his medical education&mdash; <a href="~/academics/clinical-sciences.aspx" target="_blank">clinical rotations</a> &ndash; he is filled with excitement. &ldquo;Although my time on campus is coming to an end, I am pleased to know that I have made an impact on the school, my fellow students and the community.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />
 <em>Prior to enrolling at AUC, Wesley Nilsson, of Fruita, Colorado, earned his undergraduate degree in biology from the University of Nevada Reno.&nbsp;</em><br />

 <h3>
 <strong>GRADUATION SPEAKERS </strong></h3>
 <p>
 <img alt="" src="~/getmedia/865d57e8-a3e1-4453-9a80-e4cb17384f5e/DSC_0342.aspx?width=321&amp;height=213" style="width: 321px; height: 213px; float: left; margin: 5px;" />The keynote address was given by <a href="http://www.aucmed.edu/alumni/alumni-profiles/steven-brooks.aspx">Steven Brooks, MD</a> (Class of 2005). Dr. Brooks is a Board-certified surgeon and 2010 recipient of the American College of Surgeons&rsquo; prestigious Resident Award for Exemplary Teaching. Currently, he holds the positions of Assistant Trauma Medical Director, Director of the Geriatric Trauma Unit and Surgical Director of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center in Lubbock, Texas.<br />
 <br />
 Randy McCreery, MD and <a href="http://www.aucmed.edu/blog/march-2015/brittany-mott-lands-psychiatry-residency.aspx">Brittany Mott, MD</a> were chosen by their peers as graduation speakers. They both expressed the profound effect studying at AUC and being part of the campus community had on them.<br />
 <br />
 Dr. McCreery was particularly touched by the culture of &ldquo;competition without animosity&rdquo; and attributed his success in large part to it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a graduate of AUC and I am going to be a doctor at one of the premier infectious disease hospitals in the country,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The AUC community got me there.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;AUC gave us a chance when no one else would. We stand here today with our dreams achieved because we didn&#39;t give&nbsp;<img alt="" src="~/getmedia/01320244-f11f-454e-83e2-bc9872631d62/Student-Speaker-Dr-Mott.aspx?width=321&amp;height=213" style="width: 321px; height: 213px; float: right; margin: 2px;" />up. I hope you go onto achieve your career dreams and thrive in happiness.&rdquo; said Dr. Mott, who earned a Psychiatry residency at the University of Rochester, New York. &ldquo;You have become my second family, and it has been an absolute honor to learn medicine with all of you, and to share this moment where years of exam grade numbers have finally become the letters MD.&rdquo;</p>
 <h3>
 <br />
 <strong>INAGURAL TRANSFORMATIONAL AWARDS PRESENTED </strong></h3>
 <p>
 In 2015, AUC created the Executive Dean Transformational Award to honor those whose vision and execution transformed the educational content and approach at AUC. The inaugural recipients of this award were Malary Mani, MD (Class of 2015) and Nimish Sudan, a former AUC student, for their creation of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10151426552853953.1073741825.257555958952&amp;type=1">Project HELP</a>, and Dr. Best for his co-leadership of the Platform Public Health, Social Development and Labor/AUC.<br />
 <br />
 Dr. Mani and Mr. Sudan created Project HELP to enhance the exposure to clinical experiences during the medical sciences curriculum. In collaboration with the Ministry of Health, Project HELP has grown to support the healthcare needs of uninsured and under-served residents of Sint Maarten. It also creates a collaborative learning environment for patients, AUC physicians-in-training, and St. Maarten physicians.<br />
 <br />
 <img alt="" src="~/getmedia/5ab4a0ea-cd4e-49a0-845c-5529b97d05e4/DSC_0194.aspx?width=300&amp;height=199" style="width: 300px; height: 199px; float: left; margin: 5px;" />Dr. Chumley presented the Executive Dean Transformational Award to Dr. Earl Best, Inspector General of Health, on behalf of the university. &ldquo;Dr. Best has provided visionary leadership, has a remarkable positive spirt, and continues to support the growth of existing and new initiatives between AUC and St. Maarten,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;This enhances the education received by graduates of our institution and addresses the public health needs of St. Maarten.&rdquo;</p>
 <h3>
 <strong>RESIDENCY AND BEYOND</strong></h3>
 <p>
 As the commencement ceremonies concluded, graduates prepared for the next milestone on their journey by reading the Physician&rsquo;s Oath/Declaration of Geneva. In doing so, they pledged their dedication to the humanitarian goals of medicine and vowed to abide by it as they begin their residency training.<img alt="" src="~/getmedia/dce72d0a-8cb4-4d21-9f00-0a06de4421fb/DSC_0002.aspx?width=321&amp;height=213" style="width: 321px; height: 213px; float: right; margin: 5px;" /></p>
 <p>
 This year, AUC graduates earned <a href="http://aucmed.edu/blog/march-2015/auc-grads-match-into-residencies-across-the-us-in.aspx">residencies</a> in specialties such as child neurology, ophthalmology,&nbsp;general surgery, pediatrics, radiology, and emergency medicine. Many will also help to address the United States&rsquo; significant unmet need in family medicine, internal medicine and pediatrics.</p>
 <p>
 They begin their residency training at hospitals across the Unites States this July.&nbsp;</p>

<![CDATA[
School of Medicine&rsquo;s (AUC) Safety &amp; Security team has led to improvements in customer service and communications skills.<br />
 <br />
 AUC&rsquo;s Safety &amp; Security Department works in partnership with the campus community to reduce opportunities for incidents on campus. The department also provides outreach and education on crimes affecting campus community members.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;The safety and well-being of our campus community is my top priority,&rdquo; said Gerard Lake, Interim Safety &amp; Security Director. &ldquo;What our team learned though the TDC workshop will enable us to communicate more effectively and provide an elevated level of service.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />
 Facilitator, David McGregor, remarked that this was perhaps one of his most engaged, committed and interactive groups he has worked with. During the workshop Peter Schoof, a former Dutch special service officer, also shared his views on security perspectives and responsibilities.<br />
 <br />
 The AUC team was very motivated and committed to learning new skills&mdash; skills which would be beneficial when interacting with those who frequent the campus including students, professors and visitors. The realization that in their role as Safety and Security Officers, they are also in an ambassadorial role and often &ldquo;the face&rdquo; of AUC, provided a fresh perspective which was embraced by all. &nbsp;<br />

 American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) was pleased to welcome the Honorable Mrs. Rita
]]>
<![CDATA[
Bourne-Gumbs, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports and Acting Minister of Public Health, Social Development and Labor, and members of her cabinet to AUC&rsquo;s campus in Cupecoy, Sint Maarten.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 An important focus of the meeting was discussion of ongoing and future collaboration between the university and the Ministry on initiatives to serve the local community. AUC has a strong tradition of community engagement in Sint Maarten and has launched, promoted, and supported numerous programs benefitting the country&rsquo;s people.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;We welcome every opportunity to deepen our collaborative work with the government and our community partners,&rdquo; said Heidi Chumley, MD, Executive Dean and Chief Academic Officer of AUC. &ldquo;At AUC we view the university as a citizen-institution with a responsibility to foster the health, well-being, and potential of members of the local community. It is through joint initiatives like those created with the Ministry that we are able to provide help that truly benefits the people here.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The most recent collaboration between AUC and the Ministry of Public Health, Social Development and Labor is the mobile clinic. Launched in January, 2015, the mobile clinic delivers public health services to underserved communities, including disease screenings and advice for healthy living.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Minister Bourne-Gumbs, members of her cabinet, and several community partners were also given a guided tour of AUC&rsquo;s campus, including the new academic building that opened last year. They were able to observe up close the learning environment that AUC has created for its students, and also meet local residents who play important roles in the operation of the university.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 In addition to learning about university-led initiatives, the Ministry members learned more about service-learning activities led by AUC students in coordination with the Office for Service-Learning and Community Affairs. &ldquo;Just this semester, our students collaborated with several local organizations to assist with health and wellness screenings, tutoring and mentoring programs, and health education workshops,&rdquo; said Golden Jackson, PhD, Assistant Dean for Service-Learning and Community Affairs.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 A highlight of the campus tour included viewing the &ldquo;Island of Dreams&rdquo; mosaic displayed in AUC&rsquo;s new academic building. The large-scale art installation was created by children and teens from Hope Outreach and the ICan Foundation, two local community partners. It features images they thought were important to St. Maarten or related to health and physicians. A focal point of the mosaic is a child sitting on the beach listening to the heartbeat of his teddy bear through a stethoscope. Island scenes are also incorporated and include flamboyant trees and the causeway. &ldquo;The mosaic is a wonderful visual reminder of the connection we at AUC have with the wider St. Maarten community,&rdquo; said Jackson.<br />

of our students, March 20, 2015&mdash;Match Day&mdash;marked the next leg of their journey into residency training. And everyone here at AUC is celebrating right along with them.</p>
 <h2>
 200+ AUC Students Earn Residencies</h2>
 <p>
 This year, over 200 AUC graduates matched into a wide variety
]]>
<![CDATA[
of residency programs across the United States. Our graduates earned residencies in specialties like child neurology, general surgery, ophthalmology, pediatrics, radiology, and emergency medicine.</p>
 <p>
 In addition, many of our graduates earned spots in primary care programs, like internal or family medicine. We think that&rsquo;s important: A recent study in the&nbsp;<em>Annals of Family Medicine</em>&nbsp;projects that the US will face a shortfall of 33,000 physicians by the time 2035 hits. By helping enable our graduates to place in primary care specialties, AUC is doing its part to fill this growing physician gap in the United States.</p>
 <p>
 First-year residents will, under supervision, care for patients with a wide variety of conditions at their matched teaching hospitals in their selected specialties. AUC&rsquo;s new batch of residents will start their training this coming July.</p>
 <h2>
 Check Out a Sampling of AUC Matches</h2>
 <p>
 Here&#39;s a small sampling of some of the residencies that our grads earned through the NRMP in 2015:</p>

 AUC Dean Remarks on Grads&#39; Intelligence, Empathy</h2>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Since I became dean of AUC, I&rsquo;ve been struck by our students&rsquo; intelligence, empathy, and sheer commitment to becoming physicians,&rdquo; says Heidi Chumley, MD, Executive Dean of AUC. &ldquo;On Match Day, I hope everyone takes a moment to think, long and hard, about how far they&rsquo;ve come since they enrolled here. You were outstanding students, you will be outstanding physicians, and we couldn&rsquo;t be prouder of you.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 AUC&rsquo;s new residents celebrated together at separate Match Day events at the AUC administrative offices in Coral Gables, FL; at Nassau University Medical Center in East Meadow, NY; and Providence Hospital in Southfield, MI.</p>

<![CDATA[
American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) is proud to announce the addition of two new titles &ndash; <a href="http://www.mhprofessional.com/product.php?isbn=0071767010"><em>Color Atlas of Pediatrics</em></a> and <a href="http://www.mhprofessional.com/product.php?isbn=0071772383"><em>Color Atlas of Internal Medicine</em></a><em>, </em>co-authored by Heidi Chumley, MD, Executive Dean and Chief Academic Officer&mdash; to its collection of medical education resources available through the university library.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;It is crucial for future physicians to have access to quality resources which aid their ability to organize information in the same manner as practicing physicians,&rdquo; said Dean Chumley. &ldquo;Atlases provide a stimulating means for students to begin to understand what they are seeing and how visual information is used in developing a differential diagnosis and treatment plan,&rdquo; she says.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The textbooks, published by McGraw Hill, offer full-color illustrations, introductory cases, complete patient management guidelines, and evidence grades for diagnosis and treatment recommendations.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Dr. Chumley is a leader in medical education and has been recognized with national awards for teaching, leadership, and scholarship. She has previously co-authored other medical education textbooks including <em>Color Atlas of Family Medicine, </em>first and second editions.<br />

be at an all-time high. Ms. Tremp, joined the AUC community as the May 2014 recipient of the university&rsquo;s Alumni Heritage Scholarship, and has quickly become a student leader on campus.<br />
 <br />
 This semester, over 220 members of the AUC community&mdash; one of the largest turnouts to date &ndash; joined together for Community Action Day (CAD) events on campus and at locations across St. Maarten. Volunteers collaborated with several local organizations to assist with health and wellness screenings, beach cleanups, and health education workshops. This included the Alzheimer&rsquo;s Foundation, the Red Cross, the St. Maarten Diabetes Foundation, and I Can Foundation.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;Participation in this semester&rsquo;s CAD was at the highest that I&rsquo;ve been since joining AUC, and this is in large part thanks the efforts of Makenzie and other Student Volunteer Committee (SVC) members,&rdquo; said Golden Jackson, Ph.D., Assistant Dean for Service-Learning and Community Affairs. &ldquo;She assisted by promoting the events on social media, coordinating sign-ups, and distributing t-shirts. The leadership by Makenzie, and all other SVC coordinators, was invaluable.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;Once I learned that I was accepted to AUC, I began thinking of ways I could be part of the incredible community outreach projects AUC students are known for leading,&rdquo; said Ms. Tremp. &ldquo;The Student Volunteer Committee has been the perfect avenue for me, and I&rsquo;m proud of what we&rsquo;ve accomplished, particularly our work around Community Action Day and the Breakfast Club.&rdquo;This semester, the SVC continued the tradition of fundraising for the Breakfast Club. &ldquo;One of our major initiatives is to provide complimentary healthy breakfast options to student at local schools,&rdquo; said Ms. Tremp. &ldquo;We raise funds by holding shwarma sales on campus, and also coordinate a back-to-school drive to provide school supplies and funds for families in need of extra assistance.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />
 Ms. Tremp, a native of Traverse City, Michigan, graduated from Grand Valley State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in biomedical sciences.<br />

 <br />
 &ldquo;I have seen many students come and go, but none have connected with the young men of our congregation as much as Taylor,&rdquo; said Huggins Alexander, a fellow church member. &ldquo;He is a positive light in the lives of these young men.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />
 Mr. Barrett earned a bachelor of science in exercise and health science from Bingham Young University, Provo, Utah. Throughout his undergraduate studies, Barrett was a leader in his church and volunteer at Utah Valley Regional Medical Center. &ldquo;I learned the value of service and have continued down a path that led me to my passion for medicine and onto a lifelong career of learning and service,&rdquo; Barrett said.<br />
 <br />
 AUC takes great pride in creating and nurturing an environment that drives social accountability, and encourages medical students to grow personally and professionally through service learning. There are several university and student-led initiatives that benefit the citizens of St. Maarten while supporting students&rsquo; development into empathetic and socially engaged physicians.<br />
 <br />
 As a physician in training at AUC, Barrett has connected with the St. Maarten community through church-related activities. &ldquo;St. Maarten is an incredible place not only because it is stunningly beautiful, but also because of the people,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My interactions with the local community through volunteering with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have truly enriched my medical school experience.&rdquo;<br />

 We&rsquo;re proud to announce that Angela Barreto, of Houston, Texas, is the spring 2015 recipient of American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine&rsquo;s (AUC) Student Engagement Award. This $5,000 scholarship recognizes students whose campus community activities have helped foster and enhance AUC&rsquo;s culture of collaboration.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;Angela is a student who gives of her time willingly to help others in any capacity possible. This is the mark of a true leader and the type of physician-in-training we at AUC are proud to reward,&rdquo; said Theresa Boyd, M.D., associate professor of pathology. &ldquo;She is an active thinker, she is innovative, and she is passionate in her desire to help others &mdash; Angela is one of the &lsquo;all-stars&rsquo; at AUC,&rdquo; she said.<br />
 <br />
 Ms. Barreto earned her Master of Public Health (Professional Option Biology) from University of North Texas Health Science Center, Fort Worth. Before attending AUC, Ms. Barreto was a nurse for over 20 years and, after deciding on a career change, steadfastly worked toward her dream of becoming a physician. &ldquo;My path to medical school was a lengthy one,&rdquo; Ms. Barretto said. &ldquo;However, throughout my life, I have been absolute in my devotion to be a physician.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />
 Throughout her medical sciences years at AUC, Ms. Barreto has served in leadership roles such as president of the AUC chapter of the American Medical Association, volunteered for numerous Community Action Day initiatives and assisted fellow physicians-in-training through her role as an Anatomy Teaching Assistant.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;My intentions of becoming a primary care physician and running a nonprofit community-based health clinic are clear,&rdquo; said Ms. Barreto. &ldquo;I have the conviction to continue to play a major role in the community by extending my career in medicine and I am honored that this scholarship recognizes my dedication.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />

g a learning environment that drives student engagement and social accountability. AUC is both a citizen institution and community steward in St. Maarten, serving as a strong advocate for the country&rsquo;s health and well-being,&rdquo; said Ronald Testa, Ph.D, medical sciences dean. &ldquo;Our award recipients embody the AUC spirit and their demonstrated commitment to service is truly inspiring.&rdquo;</p>

 The Student Engagement Award recognizes students whose activities help to sustain and enhance collaboration, open-mindedness, and a shared sense of the medical student journey. It was presented to Howard Brent and Andrew Iskandar.</p>
 <p class="Default">
 &quot;Andrew has always presented himself as a physician-in-training who understands his success is clearly linked to the success of the whole student body and the university,&rdquo; said Susan DeMesquita, professor and acting chair, department of neuroscience and physiology. Embracing collaborative success was also exemplified by Mr. Brent. &ldquo;Howard gives to others by sharing his knowledge to promote the success of this fellow physicians-in-training,&rdquo; said Theresa Boy, M.D., associate professor of pathology.</p>
 <p class="Default">
 The Social Accountability Award was presented to Allison Kruger and Patricia Kindsvater, who have both shown leadership and commitment in working with community organizations in St. Maarten.</p>

nts committed to strengthening primary care and family medicine in the northeast region of the United States. The meeting provides a forum for participants to share information about educational, clinical, policy, and research issues affecting primary health care. It also provides networking opportunities, including a special program for employers seeking to hire family physicians and a residency fair geared to medical students preparing to enter the 2015 Match.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;As a family medicine physician, I was pleased to see so many of our students express an interest in this field,&rdquo; said Heidi Chumley, M.D., executive dean and chief academic officer of AUC. &ldquo;A career in primary care can be incredibly rewarding and this was a unique opportunity for our students and graduates to connect with like-minded individuals.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Sixty-five AUC graduates secured residency positions in family medicine programs in the 2014 residency match. Joy Checa, M.D., a clinical research fellow at AUC who was in attendance, believes an increase in the number of family medicine practitioners is the answer to the United States&rsquo; need for primary care physicians. &ldquo;This specialty requires a unique skillset and allows a physician to play an active role in a patient&rsquo;s health over the course of many years,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was rewarding to learn about current research in the field and to hear more about the future of healthcare and the interesting career options available to family physicians.&rdquo;<br />

ilable to those most in need.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 This year, members of the AUC community took part in the fifth annual Pink Parade. This parade, organized by the Positive Foundation, recognizes those who have lost their lives to breast cancer, those who have survived it and those who are still engaged in the struggle.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;AUC and its students have played an integral part in the breast cancer awareness movement in St. Maarten for over 15 years,&rdquo; said Shelly Alphonso, Positive Foundation president. &ldquo;They have supported our parade from its inception five years ago, and we continue to count on their assistance with breast self-examination demonstrations.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The Positive Foundation&rsquo;s primary goal is to ensure that women in St. Maarten are aware that early detection of breast cancer through regular breast self-examinations, scheduled mammograms and clinical breast examination can greatly increase early detection of breast cancer and improve the odds of recovery and survival.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Naira Chobanyan, M.D., Ph.D., Sc.D, AUC associate professor of clinical medicine and internationally known breast cancer researcher, trained the team of AUC physicians-in-training who provided breast self-examinations at the St. Maarten Medical Center and the Dutch Quarter Medical Center. Complimentary clinical breast exams and mammogram vouchers for uninsured residents were also offered.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;Volunteering with the Positive Foundation was a valuable opportunity for us to not only use some of the skills and knowledge we have as medial students, but also to hopefully make a difference in the community,&rdquo; said Patricia Kindsvater, fourth semester medical sciences student. &ldquo;We interacted on a personal level with others to promote and facilitate health and wellness, which&nbsp;reinforced the reasons we decided to become physicians.&rdquo;<br />

ngeles, and a former research associate at City of Hope, a laboratory focused on translational research and investigating the potential of neural stem cells for the targeted treatment of cancers. Here, she shares what motivated her to take the next step toward becoming a physician, the factors that led to her choose AUC, and her plans for the future.<br />
 <br />
 <strong>AUC: Ms. Gilchrist, since earning your kinesiology degree you&rsquo;ve become heavily involved in research. This included a prestigious internship as a California Institute of Regenerative Medicine Bridges to Stem Cell Research Scholar. &nbsp;What led to the decision to change gears and attend medical school? </strong><br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 <strong>Ms. Gilchrist:</strong> For 18 years, my ambition to become a physician has not wavered, however my understanding of what it requires to become a physician has evolved due to the path my journey has taken. From clinical shadowing to public health outreach and most recently translational research, my experiences have shaped my vision of the physician I want to become.<br />
 <br />
 Over the past three years, my research experience at City of Hope, a laboratory focused on translational research and investigating the potential of neural stem cells for the targeted treatment of cancers, has given me a unique perspective on healthcare, particularly with regard to drug development and regulation. During this time I have gained invaluable experience, but also realized my work was missing an integral component&mdash;patient interaction. I observed my mother motivated and rewarded by her relationships with her patients as a women&#39;s health nurse practitioner. This experience and realization reinforced my long-held desire to become a physician.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 <strong>AUC: How did you become interested in and ultimately choose to attend AUC? </strong><br />
 <strong>Ms. Gilchrist:</strong> I first heard about AUC from a friend and fellow University of Southern California alum. He was in his fifth semester of medical school at AUC and he had nothing but amazing things to say about the university. This together with timing and the opportunity to study abroad where key factors for me.<br />
 <br />
 My decision to apply to AUC occurred in June. Since AUC has a September class; and I was eager to begin, the timing was perfect. Additionally, I always regretted not studying abroad during my undergraduate years and with the campus being in St. Maarten, this was a great opportunity to get that experience. Plus, the availability of clinical rotations in the UK to AUC students was also an appealing opportunity to gain exposure to a different healthcare system.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 <strong>AUC: You have aspirations to become an oncologist. How does it feel to begin your journey to achieving this goal at AUC?</strong><br />
 <br />
 <strong>Ms. Gilchrist:</strong> At the moment it feels a bit surreal. I am ecstatic to begin my journey, but at the same time somewhat nervous.&nbsp; So far, AUC and St. Maarten have been amazing! The first weekend before classes, I was able to explore some of St. Maarten, and I cannot wait until after block exams to get a chance to explore a bit more.&nbsp; AUC and the classes themselves have been intellectually invigorating! It has at times been challenging getting back into full time studying after such a long hiatus from school, but every professor is enthusiastic to be here every single morning; which definitely helps after the late nights of studying.<br />
 <br />
 It is evident the professors are teaching our classes because they truly want to be teaching, which I find to be in stark contrast to my undergraduate experience. Consistent with my aspirations to become an oncologist, my group in anatomy lab coincidentally received a cadaver that previously underwent a mastectomy. I felt privileged and humbled to be able to observe the residual effects of this cancer treatment, especially because part of my research was investigating alternative treatment options for breast cancer. It has definitely been a poignant start to my journey at AUC, and continues to reaffirm that I am on the right path for myself.<br />
 <br />
 My desire is to one day be as incredible as the physicians I have been so fortunate to work with at City of Hope. I intend to provide cancer patients the hope and support that many of them so desperately need. I am thankful my path brought me to AUC; a place I believe will provide me the opportunity to achieve what I have pursued for 18 years.<br />

The Career Commitment Scholarship, an award in the amount of $10,000, recognizes students who were previously employed in the healthcare profession and are ready to take the next step to becoming a physician.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;At AUC, the diversity of our students strengthens the educational experience for everyone. Empowering hard working students who have strived academically while also contributing to the common good in their communities is integral to our mission,&rdquo; said Heidi Chumley, MD, executive dean and chief academic officer of AUC. &ldquo;As someone who has already had a career in the healthcare field, Daniel has shown a commitment to serving others, and we honor and encourage this commitment by investing in him through this scholarship.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Mr. Plavin earned his undergraduate degree in chemistry from Binghamton University, New York. While pursuing his degree, Mr. Plavin became certified as a firefighter and EMT and dedicated himself to this profession after graduating. &ldquo;Because of my background, I can enter medical school knowing that practicing medicine is something I love and will love for the rest of my life,&rdquo; said Mr. Plavin.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Having gone through AUC&rsquo;s orientation week on campus, Mr. Plavin&rsquo;s medical education journey is on its way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited about everything AUC has to offer. It&rsquo;s almost overwhelming&mdash; whether it&rsquo;s making new lifelong friends, learning in the [high-tech] simulation center with the Harvey<sup>&reg;</sup> the SimMan<sup>&reg;</sup>, or engaging with professors in the classroom, I&rsquo;m so happy I chose AUC.&rdquo;<br />

Local Health Organizations Partner with American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine for Project HELP
]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
Students currently studying to be physicians at American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) recently provided over 20 St. Maarten residents with complimentary healthcare screenings at the Salvation Army in Cole Bay. It was the latest health and wellness event held by Project HELP, a student-led initiative that collaborates with the Ministry of Public Health, Social Development and Labor and The Diabetes Foundation.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;Project HELP is an outstanding example of the positive impact we can make by working together,&rdquo; said Golden Jackson, Ph.D, director of service-learning and community affairs at AUC. &ldquo;It is a valued opportunity for AUC students to work alongside local doctors to provide screening for chronic diseases, interact with patients and share health and wellness tips.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Information gathered during the screenings for glucose, cholesterol, blood pressure, vision and body mass index contributes to a more complete picture of health status on the island. This will assist the Ministry of Health&rsquo;s efforts to combat preventable conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and obesity. &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;Community outreach events such as Project HELP are becoming increasingly important in St. Maarten. It provides residents of Cole Bay and the surrounding area access to health screenings regardless of their insurance coverage status&rdquo; said Lotty Peterson, president, The Diabetes Foundation. &ldquo;We look forward to AUC&rsquo;s much appreciated and needed assistance at the upcoming World Diabetes Awareness walk-a-thon in November.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />

on of a large-scale mosaic, inspired and created by children of St. Maarten and the artist Jimmy Lucero, was celebrated on Wednesday, Aug. 13, at the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) campus in Cupecoy. The project was developed over six sessions during June and July, during which children and teens from AUC, Hope Outreach and the I Can Foundation participated in the creation of the piece.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Each session focused on a different element of the creative process. Children contributed images they thought were important to St. Maarten or related to health and physicians. The centerpiece of the mosaic is a child sitting on the beach listening to the heartbeat of his teddy bear with a stethoscope. Images from the island include flamboyant trees, the causeway and medical images.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The mosaic&rsquo;s title, &ldquo;Island of Dreams,&rdquo; reflects the hopes and dreams of the children and of students who come to AUC to study medicine. Children contributed to every step in its creation, from generating ideas for content through drawings and paintings to placing, grouting and cleaning the tiles.&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Three children who worked on the mosaic, Melany Ellis, Jenesqua Violenes, and Trinity Edwards, expressed appreciation for the experience. Highlights for them were learning to mix colors and grouting and cleaning the mural. Heidi Chumley, MD, executive dean of AUC, thanked the children for their contribution to the new building and encouraged them to continue their enthusiasm for and appreciation of art.&nbsp;<br />

Community Action Day brought together over 160 AUC students, faculty and staff with members of the Sint Maarten Diabetes Foundation, iCAN Foundation, SXM Paws, Lowlands Community Garden, and the Tzu Chi Foundation.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;Each of the day&rsquo;s activities were planned in partnership with a local Sint Maarten organization to improve overall health and wellness. The events gave students the opportunity to work alongside community members effecting positive change and develop into a more engaged and empathetic future physician,&rdquo; said Golden Jackson, director of service learning and community affairs at AUC. &nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 AUC volunteers participated in initiatives such as health care screenings for diabetes and chikungunya, planting fresh fruit and vegetable gardens, cultivating creativity in children through multimedia arts, animal adoptions to improve animal welfare, and the renovation of a shelter for victims of domestic violence. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 One of the community organizations that AUC volunteers supported was the Sint Maarten Diabetes Foundation. According to the organization&rsquo;s president, Charlotte Peterson, there has been an increase in Type 2 diabetes diagnoses across the island. AUC students helped provide complimentary glucose and blood pressure screenings.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;The assistance by AUC students at each of our events makes it possible for us to achieve our goals,&rdquo; said Peterson. &ldquo;I look forward to AUC&rsquo;s support at our World Diabetes Day walk-a-thon in November. We wouldn&rsquo;t be able to do it without them.&rdquo;<br />

<![CDATA[
a doctor since I&nbsp;was in junior high school. I would see my aunt, a cardiologist, work tirelessly to provide care for each of her patients. She was also a mentor to many, offering guidance and support. I remember wanting to be just like her&mdash; this led me on my path to medical school. AUC gave me the opportunity to begin my medical school journey and supported me along the way. The education I received helped me succeed through medical school and during residency.</p>
 <p>
 <strong>AUC: </strong>Can you share what your experience was like at AUC? What aspects of it are most memorable?</p>
 <p>
 <strong>Jagtiani</strong><strong>: </strong>Moving thousands of miles away from home to attend medical school was, at first, a bit scary. However, the support I received from my peers and also from our professors made all the difference. Medical school is tough; the workload is heavy and the materials are complicated. The study groups we formed and the availability of our professors outside of the classroom allowed us to be tackle complex concepts and ultimately to be successful. When time permitted, we explored the island&rsquo;s amazing beaches, restaurants, and took part in community events. We developed a tight knit community, forming a family away from home.<br />
 <br />
 During my clinical years, I felt fortunate to rotate though hospitals across the country. I secured a residency in my home state of California, and can apply what I learned from my interactions with physicians working in different healthcare environments and from the diverse patient populations I encountered.<br />
 <br />
 <strong>AUC: </strong>What advice do you have for current AUC students who are either in medical sciences or completing their clinical rotations?<br />
 <br />
 <strong>Jagtiani</strong><strong>:</strong> I&rsquo;m grateful that AUC gave me a chance. Had I not been accepted, I may not be where I am today. For many students, it may be difficult to envision where they will be at the end of their medical school journey, but they should treat each day of that journey as another opportunity to learn - even learning from their mistakes. Making mistakes is inevitable, so learn from them. Eventually students will have a bank of knowledge and experience to draw on.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 <strong>AUC: </strong>You were recently appointed chief medical resident at Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital&rsquo;s Internal Medicine Residency Program. &nbsp;How does it feel to attain this accomplishment and where will you go from there?<br />
 <br />
 <strong>Jagtiani</strong>: I feel honored and fortunate to be selected as a chief medical resident. Similar to my experience at AUC, I am part of a close-knit community of smart, hardworking, and charismatic peers. I&#39;m currently working on my application for a fellowship in infectious diseases. Once I have completed my fellowship, I would like to be part of a multi-specialty group practice associated with an academic center. I love both inpatient and outpatient medicine and envision a future where I have a little bit of both on a daily basis. I also have a passion for teaching and hope to one day return to AUC as a professor.<br />

 <p>
 Eleah Porter prepared a poster entitled &quot;<em>A Rare Cause of Massive Hematuria: Renal Artery Aneurysm Rupture&quot;</em> based on a patient encounter during her third year surgery core at The Brooklyn Hospital Center. While completing her&nbsp;surgical oncology clerkship at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, Ms. Porter attended the 2014 American College of Physicians (ACP) National Conference in Orlando, Florida. At the conference, she presented her poster, and it was selected as a National Winner in the Student Clinical Vignette division.</p>
 <p>
 While preparing my poster, I engaged with several physicians who were involved in the case. It took a lot of time and dedication, and to experience success is motivating,&rdquo; said Ms. Porter. &ldquo;I hope more AUC students take advantage of similar opportunities.</p>
 <p>
 Two posters were presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies and Asian Society for Pediatric Research 2014 Joint Meeting in Vancouver, Canada by clinical students rotating at Ealing General Hospital in the United Kingdom. Tianne Foster presented <em>Dogs and Pediatric Dental Health- the Work of May Mellanby. Mapping Health Indeces and Commissioning Better Value Community Health Care </em>was presented by Carissa Monterosso and Kaci Dudley.</p>

nation will be used to renovate and equip the hospital&#39;s expanded Surgical Simulation and Procedural Skills Training Center.&nbsp;<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine is proud to join Providence Hospital in this important endeavor focused on improving patient safety and training students, residents, staff physicians and allied health professionals to provide patient-centered care as part of a highly integrated medical team,&rdquo; says Heidi Chumley, M.D., executive dean and chief academic officer, AUC.<br />
 <br />
 Providence Hospital&rsquo;s expanded Surgical Simulation and Procedural Skills Training Center, scheduled to open in 2015, will support St. John Providence Health System&rsquo;s commitment to providing safe, patient-centered care, grounded in evidence-based science.<br />
 <br />

<![CDATA[ AUC Awards Inaugural Alumni Heritage Scholarship ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) has named MaKenzie Tremp the inaugural recipient of the university&rsquo;s Alumni Heritage Scholarship. Ms. Tremp, a native of Traverse City, Michigan, is a member of AUC&rsquo;s incoming class in May. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The new scholarship program, which covers tuition for the first semester, engages AUC alumni in the process of identifying aspiring physicians who are currently living AUC&rsquo;s core values. &ldquo;AUC students demonstrate social accountability, embrace diverse life experiences and are engaged students and citizens,&rdquo; said Heidi Chumley, MD, executive dean and chief academic officer. &ldquo;The Alumni Heritage Scholarship recognizes and rewards incoming students who exemplify the breadth and depth of AUC&rsquo;s culture beyond academics.&rdquo; &nbsp;<img alt="" src="~/getmedia/5c6800ec-56b7-4800-9761-7980f82d1394/Makenzie-Tremp-Heritage-Scholarship-may-2014.aspx?width=250&amp;height=350" style="width: 250px; height: 350px; vertical-align: top; margin: 20px;" /><br />
 Ms. Tremp, a graduate of Grand Valley State University with a Bachelor of Science degree in biomedical sciences, gained recognition for her mission trip in China and clinical work as a certified nurse&rsquo;s assistant. &ldquo;If you would have asked me at age three what I wanted to be when I grew up, I would have told you &lsquo;a baby doctor,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In May, I will officially be on my way.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 She was nominated by Thomas Lammy, MD, a 1981 AUC graduate who is an internist at the Suttons Bay Medical Clinic in Suttons Bay, Michigan, which is affiliated with Munson Medical Center. With a medical career spanning more than 30 years, Dr. Lammy is familiar with the challenges of pursuing a medical education.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;Although I graduated from AUC many years ago, the strong relationships I built there and the sense of community I enjoyed left a lasting impact,&rdquo; said Lammy. &ldquo;I know MaKenzie will be a leader in her class and I would be proud to one day have her as a colleague.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Upon receiving the news of the award, Ms. Tremp said, &ldquo;I was already incredibly prepared to dig in my heels and find success at AUC. Now I feel a sense of pride in having received this scholarship and the ability to be part of the incredible community of which Dr. Lammy speaks highly.&rdquo;<br />

AUC Joins American Red Cross for Disaster Preparedness Efforts in Florida and New York

<![CDATA[
<img alt="" src="~/AUC/media/Images/Misc/redcrossSM.jpg" /><br />
 <br />
 American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) is proud to have partnered with the American Red Cross on April 12 to assist disaster preparedness efforts in South Florida and New York.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;AUC students have a demonstrated commitment to community involvement and service. This shared value is something we look for and encourage&mdash; it helps to make our school unique.&rdquo; said Heidi Chumley, M.D., Executive Dean and Chief Academic Officer. &ldquo;Saturday&rsquo;s events brought together newly accepted students and assisted the disaster relief efforts for which the Red Cross is known.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />
 In South Florida, AUC medical students prepared and took inventory of emergency kits to ensure South Florida shelters are ready for the upcoming hurricane season. Students in New York prepared and delivered supply kits to churches, food banks and other locations. &nbsp;<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;The Red Cross of the South Florida Region appreciates the opportunity to work with AUC in helping us be better prepared to serve the community in case of hurricanes,&rdquo; said South Florida Region Disaster Program Officer Carlos Castillo. &ldquo;The Red Cross supports shelter operations and having full-stocked and maintained shelter kits enable us to be more efficient in establishing shelters when needed.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />
 The Red Cross responds to approximately 70,000 disasters in the United States every year, ranging from home fires that affect a single family to hurricanes that affect tens of thousands, to earthquakes that impact millions.<br />

AUC Partners with Government to Combat the Spread of Mosquito-Borne Diseases
]]>

<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>
 One of the benefits of studying at American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) is the opportunity to participate in research and public health initiatives. As a Caribbean medical school committed to advancing public health, AUC has an important role to play in addressing the
]]>
<![CDATA[
healthcare challenges of the region. A new initiative, led by the Sint Maarten Ministry of Health, Social Development and Labor, will draw upon AUC faculty and physicians-in-training to combat the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Two of these diseases are dengue fever and chikungunya. Both diseases, characterized by flu-like symptoms, are transmitted by the bite of infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Dengue is prevalent in Asia, Africa, and parts of the Americas, but chikungunya has only recently been confirmed in the western hemisphere. In Sint Maarten, the Honorable Minister Cornelius de Weever has requested AUC&rsquo;s assistance in efforts to identify high-risk areas for mosquito breeding in Sint Maarten and determine a baseline on risk areas.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;AUC is honored to partner with the government of Sint Maarten to address this serious health issue,&rdquo; said Ronald Testa, PhD, dean of medical sciences. &ldquo;This initiative provides our faculty and physicians-in-training with an opportunity to study medicine in a global and regional context, with the potential to affect the health and well-being of our local community and the wider region.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The global incidence of dengue has risen dramatically in recent years, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). An estimated 500,000 people each year require hospitalization for serious dengue, with death occurring in about 2.5 percent of cases. Now the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control is monitoring the first cases of chikungunya reported in the Caribbean. Although most people who suffer from chikungunya recover completely, in some cases joint pain can persist for a prolonged period, according to WHO.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Kathleen Shupe, PhD, AUC professor of microbiology and immunology, is part of the AUC team working with the government. Dr. Shupe, who is a former lead infectious disease epidemiologist with the Texas Department of Health, said, &ldquo;This is a unique opportunity for our students to examine an important healthcare challenge from multiple perspectives: the transmission, diagnosis, and treatment of disease, as well as the public health response.&rdquo; &nbsp;<br />

ing a strong focus on the relationship between physicians and their patients.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;I feel strongly about the trend toward patient-centered care and the shared decision-making process between physicians and patients. At AUC, we teach students the importance of establishing a rapport with patients versus relying on technology to take care of them,&rdquo; she said.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 This emphasis on high-touch, not just high-tech, has also been part of AUC&rsquo;s educational mission. Dr. McCarty and her faculty colleagues commit themselves to being accessible to students&mdash;partners in their education. Now, says Dr. McCarty, technology is playing a greater role in enhancing the student experience, and augmenting the learning culture that AUC has long cultivated.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;The simulation center and facilities of our new academic building increase the fidelity of clinical skills training and has also led to curriculum improvement,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The technology our students now have at their disposal gives them the opportunity to be more successful.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 While patient-centered care is the ultimate goal of the medical education program at AUC, student-centered education attracts many of the faculty, including Dr. McCarty. &ldquo;Being at AUC allows me to focus on what is important to me&mdash; medical education. There are no competing components; professors here are focused on their students. There is an atmosphere of education,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is enjoyable to work with a group of students who are in medicine for the right reason&mdash;because they really want to make a difference and help others.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Sarah McCarty, MD earned her medical degree from the University of Vermont and completed her residency in Internal Medicine at Marshall University School of Medicine. Prior to joining AUC, she was the Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and Director of the Clinical Skills Laboratory at Marshall University.<br />

Calgary Student Awarded Medical School Scholarship by American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine

<![CDATA[
<img alt="" src="~/getmedia/6b00b129-768f-471a-a0a0-4b4addb63ae0/Kiser.aspx?width=400&amp;height=263" style="width: 400px; height: 263px; float: right; margin: 14px;" />Mr. Alexander Kiser, of Calgary, Alberta, has been awarded the Dean&rsquo;s Award of Merit Scholarship by the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC). The scholarship, in the amount of USD $10,000 recognizes students who come to AUC with exceptional academic achievements and a demonstrated commitment to service.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;Applicants to AUC are bright and ambitious, and attuned to the impact they can make by becoming physicians who are engaged with their community through service,&rdquo; said Heidi Chumley, MD, executive dean and chief academic officer of AUC.&nbsp; &ldquo;These scholarships are designed to recognize and support future physician leaders, and Alexander is a deserving recipient.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Mr. Kiser&rsquo;s interest in the medical field grew with his exposure to health care through volunteer opportunities in his native Canada and Ghana. While pursuing a degree in medical sciences at the University of Western Ontario, he volunteered at the Peter Lougheed Hospital in Calgary, Canada. This experience motivated him to seek international volunteer experience in Ghana. There, he worked with other volunteers at a rural disability center, and assisted with HIV awareness.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;My time in Ghana inspired my desire to travel and participate in global health initiatives. It also influenced my desire to attend AUC where I can learn in a supportive environment with students from around the world and gain a global perspective,&rdquo; said Mr. Kiser.&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 As a first semester physician-in-training, Mr. Kiser&rsquo;s involvement with community outreach has already begun. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve volunteered with the iCan Foundation, participating in the beach day activities with children from their foster home,&rdquo; he shared. &ldquo;As I adapt to the rigors of medical school, I look forward to playing a greater role in the many outreach opportunities available through AUC.&rdquo;<br />

Virginia Student Earns Medical School Scholarship from American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine

<img alt="" src="~/getmedia/b09b74be-aefe-4bd5-8ddf-096e326ab690/Singh.aspx?width=400&amp;height=335" style="width: 400px; height: 335px; float: right; margin: 14px;" />Mr. Amrit Singh, of South Riding, Virginia, was recently the recipient of the highest scholarship award given by the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC). The Dean&rsquo;s Award of Excellence Scholarship, an award in the amount of $25,000, recognizes students who come to AUC with exceptional academic achievements and a demonstrated commitment to service. Singh is one of the top incoming students in AUC&rsquo;s January 2014 class.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;Applicants to AUC are bright and ambitious, and attuned to the impact they can make by becoming physicians who are engaged with their community through service,&rdquo; said Heidi Chumley, MD, executive dean and chief academic officer of AUC. &ldquo;The scholarship committee and I were impressed by what Amrit has accomplished so far and I look forward to seeing him develop into a physician at AUC.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Mr. Singh earned his undergraduate degree in biology from the University of Virginia. As a child he observed his grandfather, an herbalist in India, provide relief from pain and illness to those in their rural community. &ldquo;It was then that the seed for community service was planted in my heart,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My commitment to the field of medicine continued as I pursued medical research at the National Institutes of Health and volunteered at the Inova Hospital in Virginia.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 At AUC, there are a multitude of outreach opportunities with community partners in Sint Maarten and students have a long-standing tradition of supporting local organizations through fundraising and volunteering. Active student groups are involved in various initiatives such as HIV awareness and screenings, health education, and diabetes testing. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Mr. Singh is only a few weeks into his first semester as a physician-in-training, and already feels at home in AUC&rsquo;s close-knit community. &ldquo;My experience at AUC exceeds expectations. So far, it has been great, and I believe it can only get better in the coming semesters as I familiarize myself and get used to the new culture of medical school,&rdquo; said Mr. Singh.<br />

incoming students in the January 2014 class. The scholarships recognize students who come to AUC with exceptional academic achievements and a demonstrated commitment to service.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Mr. Amrit Singh, of South Riding, Virginia, received the Dean&rsquo;s Award of Excellence Scholarship, an award in the amount of $25,000. Mr. Alexander Kiser, of Calgary, Alberta, received the Dean&rsquo;s Award of Merit Scholarship, in the amount of $10,000. Both are first-semester physicians-in-training at AUC.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;Applicants to AUC are bright and ambitious, and attuned to the impact they can make by becoming physicians who are engaged with their community through service,&rdquo; said Heidi Chumley, MD, executive dean and chief academic officer of AUC.&nbsp; &ldquo;These scholarships are designed to recognize and support future physician leaders, and Amrit and Alexander are deserving recipients.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Mr. Singh earned his undergraduate degree in biology from the University of Virginia. As a child he observed his grandfather, an herbalist in India, provide relief from pain and illness to those in their rural community. &ldquo;It was then that the seed for community service was planted in my heart,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My commitment to the field of medicine continued as I pursued medical research at the National Institutes of Health and volunteered at the Inova Hospital in Virginia.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Mr. Kiser&rsquo;s interest in the medical field grew with his exposure to health care through volunteer opportunities in his native Canada and Ghana. &nbsp;While pursuing a degree in medical sciences at the University of Western Ontario, he volunteered at the Peter Lougheed Hospital in Calgary, Canada. He also travelled to Ghana as part of a medical mission trip. &ldquo;Attending AUC allows me to learn in a supportive environment with students from around the world and gives me a global perspective,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Both AUC scholarship awardees are focused on becoming physicians with a lifelong commitment to public health and community service. Said Mr. Singh, &ldquo;I feel strongly that with my education from AUC, and training as a physician, I can be a valuable tool in providing the health care that people need.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />
 <br />
 <var>AUC&rsquo;s Scholarships Committee is currently accepting applications for both the Dean&rsquo;s Award of Excellence Scholarship and the Dean&rsquo;s Award of Merit Scholarship.

American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine Dedicates New Academic Building

 <h2>
 Members of St. Maarten Government Join AUC and DeVry Education Group Leadership for Grand Opening</h2>
 <p>
 Just 19 months after breaking ground on the first phase of a major campus expansion project, American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) officially opened the doors on a new academic building, ushering in a new era for the institution. AUC welcomed government, community and university leaders today, who joined in celebration of this major milestone. The new building houses an anatomy lab, clinical skills training lab, simulation center and 400-seat auditorium, as well as faculty offices and additional study and learning spaces for students.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;This a momentous occasion for AUC and the DeVry Education Group, which has fully supported AUC&rsquo;s mission and demonstrated their commitment to high-quality medical education,&rdquo; said Heidi Chumley, M.D., executive dean of AUC. &ldquo;This investment is not only in our campus, but in the community of St. Maarten.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Dr. Chumley was joined at the dedication by university colleagues and students, and members of the St. Maarten government, including Prime Minister Sarah Wescot-Williams.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;You can imagine my pride, our pride, when we witnessed this building going up and seeing it completed today,&rdquo; said Prime Minister Wescot-Williams. The prime minister also recognized AUC&rsquo;s community involvement. &ldquo;As you entered this hall you would have seen some of the many organizations with whom this school has worked with already, and I know that group will only continue to grow.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Construction on the new academic facility commenced in June 2012, only 10 months after AUC was acquired by DeVry Education Group. The $30 million project was conceived to bring updated technologies and physical space improvements that would complement AUC&rsquo;s strong learning culture. Ronald Testa, Ph.D., dean of medical sciences, said, &ldquo;AUC has nurtured an academic community where students, faculty and staff work cooperatively toward the common good. We are delighted to enhance this high-touch learning environment with a high-tech facility that will support our learners.&rdquo; Dr. Testa noted that AUC faculty, staff and students provided input in the early stages of the building&rsquo;s planning and design.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 At the building dedication, AUC also recognized the work of several community organizations, and presented contributions to the St. Maarten AIDS Foundation and the St. Maarten Diabetes Foundation.</p>

<![CDATA[ The Ideal Med School Match ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
Each year hundreds of medical students enter the National Residency Match Program with the hopes of landing in the same specialty, program type, or location as their partner or spouse. The NRMPS&rsquo;s Registration, Ranking, and Results&reg; (R3&reg;) system allows couples to form pairs of program choices on their rank order lists that are considered in rank order when the matching algorithm is processed. A record 935 couples entered the Match in 2013.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 For Drs. Lisa and Nicholas Batson (&rsquo;08), succeeding in the couples match was just the first step in becoming partners in practice. After meeting during an anatomy class almost ten years ago, they have been side by side ever since: through completion of medical school, residency, fellowship, and now as the co-leaders of the new psychiatry division at Crystal Run Healthcare, a multispecialty group practice in Middletown, New York.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 In 2008, the Batsons were one of over 700 couples that entered the Match. They secured residency appointments in psychiatry at Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Later they completed fellows in child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Louisville in Kentucky. They then joined Crystal Run in August 2013.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Lisa was exposed to the medical field at an early age. &ldquo;I was encouraged by several of the doctors that I or my family came in contact with,&rdquo; she said. She heard about American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) from a family friend whose daughter was an AUC alumna and Board-certified pediatrician. Having researched AUC in-depth, Lisa says, &ldquo;I knew that was where I wanted to attend.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 For Nicholas, the prospect of traveling abroad to attend medical school was appealing, but he knew he wanted to eventually practice in the United States. &ldquo;The fact that obtaining my medical degree from AUC would allow me to return to the states and be licensed to practice was a key determining factor,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;<br />
 <br />
 Both Batsons touted the vibrant student life and community atmosphere at AUC. Lisa, who grew up in a small town in the Hudson Valley in&nbsp;New York, said, &ldquo;I felt that the close knit community at AUC would be the best learning environment for me.&rdquo; Nicholas, who served as president of Chi Phi, the community service fraternity on the AUC campus, said, &ldquo;AUC offers many opportunities for leadership roles and community service oriented activities.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The Batsons say their education at AUC prepared them to succeed. &ldquo;AUC provided all of the resources needed, including preparatory courses, to be successful on the USMLE Step 1 exam,&rdquo; said Nicholas.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Both completed clinical rotations at multiple sites in the U.S., experiencing medicine in different contexts. Lisa stated it &ldquo;prepared us to be flexible and independent. At the time it was stressful, but at the end of it, I was prepared for residency and beyond.&nbsp; Going into the match process, we felt we were competitive candidates for residency and on par with U.S. medical school graduates.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Today the Batsons are committed to providing relief from physical and mental suffering and are dedicated to working with therapists and other medical providers to care for patients at Crystal Run. Having gone through residency and fellowship training together, and now at the head of a new psychiatry practice, Nicholas and Lisa Batson are still drawing from the lessons they learned at AUC.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;The time spent in St. Maarten grounded us and made me realize what was truly important. I was appreciative of more in life and it carries over into how I interact with my patients today,&rdquo; said Lisa.<br />

AUC and Nassau University Medical Center Complete Medical Library Renovation
]]>

<description>

For more than five years, students from American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) have been rotating through Nassau University Medical Center (NUMC) for their clinical training. This clinical education partnership has been a win-win for both institutions, with AUC students gainin

g excellent preparation for residency, and NUMC having the opportunity to train and evaluate potential future residents for their hospital.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Now the partnership has resulted in something that will benefit resident physicians, faculty, students, and patients for years to come. With funding provided by AUC, NUMC has completed a $700,000 renovation of the Dr. Peter Addiego Health Sciences Library. The two-story, 12,000 square foot library now features conference rooms equipped with interactive white boards, video conferencing, and distance learning capabilities.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;AUC develops mutually rewarding education partnerships with quality teaching sites like NUMC to provide clinical rotation opportunities for our students,&rdquo; said Heidi Chumley, MD, executive dean and chief academic officer at AUC. &ldquo;These partnerships provide much needed support to enhance academic infrastructure and technology, hire residents and teaching fellows, renovate facilities, and support indigent care, among other needs. We are delighted to play our part in the renovation of the fantastic library at NUMC.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 The original library, constructed in the early 1970s, is now up to the technological and architectural standards required for it to serve as a medical education and biomedical research hub.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;We are proud of the library renovations that will serve to improve the quality of medical education for our residents, faculty, students and nurses,&rdquo; said Steven J. Walerstein, MD, FACP, executive vice president and chief medical officer at NUMC. &ldquo;We are grateful to AUC for their funding which will help to support patient care, research and education for hundreds of students and residents at one of Long Island&rsquo;s largest medical libraries.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 At any given time there are between 75 to 100 AUC students completing their third-year core clinical clerkships and fourth-year elective rotations at NUMC &ndash; making NUMC one of the largest populations of AUC students at one hospital. NUMC is also home to AUC alumni who hold residency positions in areas such as general surgery, internal medicine, radiology, and obstetrics and gynecology.<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 &ldquo;AUC students have become part of our medical community,&rdquo; said Walerstein. &ldquo;We look forward to many more AUC students training, learning and practicing at NUMC in the future. We expect our partnership to continue for years to come.&rdquo;<br />
 &nbsp;<br />
 Founded in 1935, NUMC serves as a major teaching campus of the Health Science Center of the State University of New York at Stony Brook and is affiliated with the North Shore LIJ Health System. The 530-bed tertiary care teaching hospital is part of a 1,200-bed health care system, with a 589-bed A. Holly Patterson skilled nursing facility and six community health centers located throughout Nassau County.<br />

<description>
<![CDATA[
<div class="single" id="post-5501">
 <p>
 The American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) is dedicated to developing physicians who have a lifelong commitment to public health and community service. In keeping with this tradition, AUC kicked off the 2013-14 academic year by reaffirming relationships with non-profit organizations throughout St. Maarten. Through a number of programs, AUC students have recently supported local organizations not only by raising financial assistance but also by volunteering time out of their studies.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I am proud of the willingness of our physicians-in-training to help those in need and thankful to the St. Maarten community for welcoming our students. The medical program at AUC offers a unique opportunity to study medicine in a global context,&rdquo; said Golden Jackson, PhD, director of service learning and community affairs at AUC.</p>
 <p>
 The following are a few of the community activities that AUC has supported recently:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>
 <p>
 <strong>Breakfast Club: </strong>In September, AUC students donated more than $2,000 to the Breakfast Club. The Breakfast Club provides students at Milton Peters College, Leonard Connor School and Sint Joseph&rsquo;s Primary School with healthy breakfast options during the school year. Said Jackson, &ldquo;The young students&rsquo; smiling faces while enjoying healthy sandwiches with a cup of milk reinforced the benefits of AUC student fundraising.&rdquo;</p>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
 <li>
 <p>
 <strong>I-Can Foundation: </strong>Children from the foster home operated by the I-Can foundation continue to enjoy weekend excursions to nearby beaches with AUC students. The outings include activities such as swimming, volleyball, soccer, and water games.</p>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
 <li>
 <p>
 <strong>Positive Foundation: </strong>During October, the AUC chapter of the American Medical Women&rsquo;s Association (AUC AMWA) is working with the Positive Foundation, a non-profit organization that promotes health, to increase breast cancer awareness. &ldquo;We look forward to continuing our partnership with the Positive Foundation to provide education workshops where we can build awareness, encourage screenings and teach self-examination techniques,&rdquo; said Sarah McCarty, MD, AUC AMWA faculty advisor. Fifty members of the AUC community, including students, faculty and staff, also participated in the Positive Foundation&rsquo;s Pink Parade.</p>
 </li>
 </ul>
 <ul>
 <li>
 <p>
 <strong>Safe Haven: </strong>Phi Chi, the only on-campus fraternity, raised $1000, which they donated to Safe Haven, an organization aimed at preventing domestic violence and promoting healthy relationships.</p>

AUC Physicians-in-Training Post 100% First-Time Pass Rate on USMLE Step 1 for First Half of 2013
]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
American&nbsp;University&nbsp;of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC)&nbsp;is pleased to announce that all 107 physicians-in-training who took Step 1 of the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)&nbsp;between January 1, 2013 and&nbsp;June 30, 2013 achieved a passing score, according to institutional reporting.
 <p>
 &ldquo;I am edified by the success of our students who achieved a 100 percent first-time pass rate on the USLME for the six-month period ending June 30,&rdquo; said Ronald J Testa, PhD, dean of the medical sciences campus in St. Maarten. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m also humbled by the highly motivated and engaged faculty and staff who work together to bring out the very best in one another which made this unprecedented accomplishment possible.</p>
 <p>
 Strong performance on the national board examinations is one of the most important factors contributing to success in obtaining a residency appointment.&nbsp;Upon passing Step 1, AUC physicians-in-training continue on to the clinical portion of their medical education, completing core and elective rotations in AUC&rsquo;s network of affiliated teaching hospitals in the United States and United Kingdom.</p>
 <p>
 Graduates of international medical schools must take and pass the&nbsp;USMLE&nbsp;if&nbsp;they want to practice in the United States.&nbsp;This is a critical requirement for the more than 90 percent&nbsp;of AUC students who are U.S. residents.&nbsp;The Step 1 exam&nbsp;is designed to&nbsp;assess medical students&rsquo; knowledge of the basic science foundation of clinical practice. According to institutional reporting,&nbsp;AUC posted&nbsp;a 96 percent pass rate&nbsp;in 2012, on par with the pass rate achieved by students at US medical schools.</p>

 <p>
 This loan program, which does not involve a credit check or require a co-signer, will offer a minimum of $1,000 per semester with a maximum of $25,000, not to exceed a cumulative loan amount of $75,000. Applications are accepted as funding is available. Eligible recipients may receive funds on a first come, first served basis.</p>

<![CDATA[
ure as executive dean at AUC, what has impressed you the most?</strong></p>
 <p>
 <strong>HC:</strong> When I was first getting to know AUC as a candidate for the executive dean position, a lot of people talked to me about the school&rsquo;s mission. A few people would refer to the mission explicitly, but many more simply talked about the school to me in a way that conveyed their part in providing an excellent medical education to qualified students of diverse backgrounds. In other words, the AUC mission is not just something that we post up on the walls or embroider onto banners. It&rsquo;s a lived mission. Since coming on board and spending more time with the faculty, students, and all the colleagues in support roles on the St. Maarten campus and in our stateside office, I&rsquo;ve come to feel this even more.</p>
 <p>
 The impact of the mission is obvious when you talk to students. They have amazing stories and experiences to share, and when you see how hard they work and the sacrifices they are making, you&rsquo;re really motivated to do more to support them. The faculty are inspiring in a different way. We have faculty who have left high-ranking positions in prestigious US institutions to come here &ndash; and it&rsquo;s because they want to commit their energy and time to teaching.</p>
 <p>
 <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>
 <strong>Q: What are your top immediate priorities as the school&rsquo;s leader?</strong></p>
 <p>
 <strong>HC:</strong> The three top priorities for this year are to enhance the clinical education, connect the campuses, and optimize the educational process. The clinical education spans all semesters, but the steepest critical learning curve occurs during the clinical cores. We will be working this year to provide additional academic support and career guidance during this critical time. We need more cross-talk between our medical science campus and clinical training sites, and among the clinical training sites. This is critical to the continual improvement of our academic program and our day-to-day operations. The educational processes touch every part of each student&rsquo;s education &ndash; from moving to St. Maarten, to scheduling clinical cores and electives, through the residency match and graduation. Our processes impact each student&rsquo;s education and my desire is that our processes are transparent, fair, and as smooth as possible. I can&rsquo;t promise the students that they won&rsquo;t ever be frustrated and I can&rsquo;t promise the students that they will always agree with changes. But I can promise that we will be working towards transparent, fair, and smooth educational processes.</p>
 <p>
 &nbsp;</p>
 <p>
 <strong>Q: AUC is in the midst of a major expansion to the campus, including a new academic building slated to open this fall. How will these changes to the campus impact the education provided at AUC?</strong></p>
 <p>
 <strong>HC: </strong>AUC has often been described as having a high-touch learning environment in which faculty work closely with students to help them acquire medical sciences knowledge, and in which students have ample opportunity for small-group learning, particularly for clinical skills acquisition. I&rsquo;ve heard directly from students about how much additional time outside of class that faculty are willing to devote to help them grasp a new concept. Students also comment on the camaraderie that exists between them: the way they coach each other and support each other. This kind of environment is central to what AUC offers. It&rsquo;s part of what defines us as an institution.</p>
 <p>
 Our faculty, staff, and students have done well in our current facilities. At the same time, we need to continually assess how well our learning environment is serving the needs of our students and faculty, not just in terms of the interactions between them, but in the use of instructional technology. The new building adds excellent spaces for anatomy, clinical skills training, and simulation enhancements, as well as more student study space and testing facilities.</p>
 <p>
 &nbsp;</p>
 <p>
 <strong>Q: AUC students and faculty alike prize the school&rsquo;s community feeling, epitomized by the relatively small class sizes and close faculty-student interaction. What do you say to those who see the new building under construction and worry that expansion will result in a loss of that community feel?</strong></p>
 <p>
 <strong>HC:</strong> The community environment at AUC is part of what&rsquo;s attractive about the school. Certainly it was a factor in my decision to join the institution. I think it&rsquo;s important to understand that despite any changes we make to the physical infrastructure of the school, or any of the technology that supports it, we still have the same goals: providing students with an excellent medical sciences foundation, helping them acquire clinical skills, and preparing them to launch successful careers. Technology or new buildings don&rsquo;t supplant those goals &ndash; they complement everything we are doing already to achieve them.</p>
 <p>
 I think our students understand this. In some areas, such as the study of anatomy, it just makes sense for us to take advantage of innovation. For certain other learning experiences, such as integrated clinical medicine, students and faculty can both see that we simply need more space where learning can happen. AUC has grown incrementally over the last several years, and likely will continue to do so, as more people who aspire to become physicians learn about us.</p>
 <p>
 <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>
 <strong>Q: The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) reported last fall that US medical schools plan to increase enrollment dramatically. Last year the rate of increase in US medical schools was only 1.5 percent, but are you concerned that increased enrollment in US schools will make it more difficult for AUC to find highly qualified applicants? </strong></p>
 <p>
 <strong>HC:</strong> Enrollment in US schools grew by 1.5 percent, but the number of first-time applicants grew by more than twice that at 3.4 percent from the previous year. The desire to attend medical school is outpacing the US schools&rsquo; capacity to enroll every qualified student. In fact, over the last 10 years, it has gotten more difficult to secure a spot in a US medical school. In 2003, the acceptance rate for US schools overall was 50 percent. Today it&rsquo;s about 45 percent.</p>
 <p>
 I believe AUC continues to be a good option for those students that the US schools cannot accommodate. I believe that a majority of the students we attract to AUC are that five percent &ndash; the students who fall just outside the class size cutoff for the US schools.</p>
 <p>
 <strong>Q: Along the same lines, there is a lot of discussion on student chat boards and elsewhere about concerns that growing enrollment in US medical schools, coupled with slow growth in the number of residency positions, will result in a difficult outlook for students at schools like AUC. What effect, if any, do you think increased enrollment in US schools will have on AUC graduates&rsquo; ability to compete for a residency position?</strong></p>
 <p>
 <strong>HC:</strong> I do understand students&rsquo; concerns about the match &ndash; it is critically important and I know it is a source of high anxiety for many. Success obtaining a residency depends in large part on the student&rsquo;s performance in the medical sciences and clinical programs, their experience, and their performance on USMLE Step 1. This goes for all students regardless of where they study. We are confident that at AUC, we are preparing our students to meet these criteria.</p>
 <p>
 AUC students achieved a 96 percent first-time pass rate on Step 1 in 2012, equal to the performance of US and Canadian students, and five percentage points better of students in osteopathic medicine programs. And the early returns from this year look great so far. Our faculty and students are ecstatic about this &ndash; it&rsquo;s a point of pride, and clearly they are doing something right.</p>
 <p>
 Our students also need to shine during their clinical rotations and electives &ndash; another huge boost to them when they apply for residency. We need to be sure they have the tools to do so. As an institution, we need to tell the AUC story so that residency program directors understand the high quality of AUC students. And we need to ensure that students receive clear guidance about how to approach the match in a manner that gives them the best chance to obtain a residency position.</p>
 <p>
 <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p>
 <strong>Q: In the 2013 match, 64% of AUC students who matched secured a position in primary care: family medicine, internal medicine, or pediatrics. Would you say that AUC has a special focus on graduating primary care physicians, or is this data a byproduct of the competitive landscape for residency &ndash; that is, that international medical graduates tend to land in less competitive specialties?</strong></p>
 <p>
 <strong>HC: </strong>First of all, as a family physician, I&rsquo;m excited by the percentage of AUC graduates who enter residency in a primary care specialty. There is no doubt in my mind that there is a nationwide shortage of primary care physicians.</p>
 <p>
 At the same time, it&rsquo;s true that in the simple mathematical terms of number of available positions, primary care specialties are less competitive than, say, dermatology, which had 38 positions in the match this year, or plastic surgery, which only had 116.</p>
 <p>
 However, one&rsquo;s specialty choice may be driven by many factors beyond simply the likelihood of securing a position. A study of 2012 medical school graduates found that personality fit and the content of the specialty were overwhelming more important in one&rsquo;s choice of specialty than competitiveness. So what does that mean for our graduates self-selecting into primary care specialties? In terms of personality, it means physicians who are interested in building long-term relationships with their patients, whether children or adults. A pediatrician, for example, has the opportunity to watch a family grow over time. Similarly a physician practicing family medicine might help an individual through a wide range of health challenges, from acute illnesses to chronic diseases. This is rewarding work when performed by one who fits the profile.</p>
 <p>
 Another attribute of our students that might contribute to the percentage who match into primary care is a sense of service. So many of our students talk about a long-held desire to serve their communities. I am proud that many do so.</p>
 <p>
 &nbsp;</p>
 <p>
 <strong>Q: What differentiates AUC from other medical schools in the Caribbean?</strong></p>
 <p>
 <strong>HC: </strong>AUC has a small community feel. Students know each other and faculty and staff know the students. An equally important question is what positively differentiates AUC from other medical schools in the United States. The most important difference is that the medical sciences faculty members are dedicated to teaching. They are not juggling research or clinical responsibilities. That is why the faculty can provide the personal attention that the students mention as one of the best things about AUC.</p>
 <p>
 <br />
 <strong>Q: What are your impressions so far of Sint Maarten?</strong></p>
 <p>
 <strong>HC: </strong>St. Maarten is known as the &ldquo;friendly island.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a beautiful place and I have felt very welcome here. Spending time in St. Maarten has helped me understand, at least in a small way, what it is like for our students who come here to study medicine. I&rsquo;ve learned where to get groceries, what the options are for housing close to campus, and how to spot the speed bumps before hitting them at full speed. I love the ocean and find the sound of the waves rejuvenating.</p>
 <p>
 But as much as I like Sint Maarten, I am also looking forward to continuing to develop relationships with our team in Coral Gables and to visiting our main clinical partners over the next year.</p>

AUC Partners with St Maarten Organizations for Community Action Day
]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<div class="single" id="post-4940">
 <p>
 An important part of the mission of American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) is a dedication to developing physicians with a lifelong commitment to public health and community service. It is this belief that drives the university&rsquo;s faculty, staff and physicians-in-training to engage with the St. Maarten residents through Community Action Day.</p>
 <p>
 The most recent Community Action Day, held June 22, gathered 131 physicians-in-training, along with members of AUC&rsquo;s faculty and administration, for events held throughout the island. &ldquo;The values of service and responsibility to one&rsquo;s community are strong at AUC,&rdquo; said Dr Golden Jackson, director of service-learning and community affairs. &ldquo;Our students demonstrate these values daily, but especially on Community Action Day when we have a greater opportunity to bring the AUC and St. Maarten communities closer together,&rdquo; added Dr Jackson.</p>
 <p>
 The day&rsquo;s events focused on health, education, animal welfare and environmental awareness and were conducted in partnership with several St. Maarten organizations. These included the Tzu Chi Foundation, Crystal House Orphanage, United Volleyb&shy;&shy;all Club, the Generation New Status Drum Band, SXM Paws, Tzu Chi Foundation, ICan, and the AUC Spouses Organization.</p>
 <p>
 Over 50 students took part in an all-day HIV-AIDS screening event with the St. Maarten AIDS Foundation. Students assisted with taking histories, performing testing, and providing counseling for over 160 residents. &ldquo;We thank the AUC physicians-in-training for their assistance and willingness to perform any task required to make the HIV testing day run smoothly,&rdquo; said Kimberley Meijers, the Community Projects Coordinator at the AIDS Foundation. &ldquo;It is with such partnerships that we can continue to run these successful testing events for the community of St. Maarten.&rdquo;</p>

<![CDATA[ AUC Recognizes 2013 Graduates ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<div class="single" id="post-4785">
 CUPECOY, Sint Maarten, May 18, 2013 &ndash; The American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) welcomed family and friends on Sat., May 18, for ceremonies to recognize the university&rsquo;s 163 new graduates.
 <p>
 The ceremony marked the culmination of tremendous efforts by the medical students to acquire the knowledge and skill required to earn a Doctorate of Medicine degree. The event is also an occasion to acknowledge the contributions of family, friends, and faculty whose encouragement and mentorship help AUC&rsquo;s students through each step in the long journey to become physicians.</p>
 <p>
 Distinguished guests included the Honorable Sarah Wescot-Williams, Prime Minister of Sint Maarten, who offered words of praise and encouragement to the graduates. The keynote address was delivered by AUC alumnus, Dr. Gabriel Gizaw, MD (&rsquo;07), who serves as an aviation medical examiner with the United States Navy.</p>
 <p>
 Dr. Heidi Chumley, who joined AUC in March as executive dean and chief academic officer, also addressed the graduates. &ldquo;The students who are coming behind you are counting on you &ndash; to demonstrate caring and competence and professionalism &ndash; and help spread the word that AUC is a fantastic school and its graduates are not only fantastic physicians but fantastic people as well,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have full confidence in you. Be the resident that everyone wants on their team. Be the resident that every patients looks forward to seeing. Be the resident that works hand in hand with other members of the healthcare system. Be the resident who makes their program a better place to train. Be a proud AUC graduate.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 The next step for many in the graduating class will be to join residency programs in hospitals across the United States. AUC graduates who entered this year&rsquo;s National Registry Match Program landed positions in 19 medical specialties.</p>
 <p>
 Ronald Testa, PhD, dean of medical sciences at AUC, noted that following last year&rsquo;s graduation ceremony, the university broke ground on a major campus expansion. &ldquo;Attendees at this year&rsquo;s festivities were able to see how those plans have taken shape in the form of an impressive new academic building,&rdquo; he said. Dr. Testa said that building, slated to open later this summer, &ldquo;is a testament to the university&rsquo;s commitment to a long and mutually beneficial partnership with the community of Sint Maarten.&rdquo;</p>

Project HELP Provides Sint Maarten Residents Complimentary Medical Evaluations and Screenings
]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>
 The first Project H.E.L.P. event was held on April 6 at the Dutch Quarter clinic of Dr. R. Sanchit and the adjacent Neighborhood Help Desk. The overall purpose of the <strong>H.E.L.P</strong>. initiative is to promote <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">h</span></strong>ealth

<![CDATA[
, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">e</span></strong>ducate participants about healthy living choices, increase <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">l</span></strong>iteracy/understanding of health risks and indicators, and focus on <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">p</span></strong>revention of illness through adoption of healthy practices. H.E.L.P. supports the healthcare needs of uninsured and perhaps under-served residents of St. Maarten.&nbsp; H.E.L.P. also serves to foster relationships within the St. Maarten community by creating a collaborative learning environment for patients, physicians-in-training, and St. Maarten licensed physicians.</p>
 <p>
 The April 6 event provided free health screenings to over 70 St. Maarten residents who came with their health concerns and desire for a health check.&nbsp; Seventeen physicians-in-training from the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) performed screening for heart health and blood pressure and checks of eyes/vision and ears/hearing. St. Maarten physician, Dr. Anand Raghosing, supervised the work of the physicians-in-training and delivered results of the screenings to each patient.</p>
 <p>
 The launch of Project H.E.L.P. is the realization of a vision of two AUC physicians-in-training, Malary Mani and Nimish Sudan, who saw a need for additional exposure to clinical experience. After discussion with AUC faculty and St. Maarten physicians, the students requested a meeting with the St. Maarten Ministry of Public Health, Social Development, and Labour to explore a collaboration around health, education, literacy and prevention. The AUC proposal fit well with the philosophy and approach of the Ministry; and continued discussions resulted in a project plan. The April 6 launch represents a collaboration of AUC, the St. Maarten Ministry of Public Health, Social Development, and Labour, a group of St. Maarten licensed physicians, and neighborhood centers.&nbsp; AUC is extremely grateful for the contributions of Minister of Public Health, Social Development and Labor, Cornelius de Weever and partners from the ministry in the development and implementation of the project.</p>
 <p>
 The collaborative organization of Project H.E.L.P. yields benefit for all partners. Educational opportunity is enhanced for AUC physicians-in-training as they perform screening exams and interact with patients and St. Maarten physicians. AUC benefits from the opportunity to engage with island neighbors in a way that addresses local priorities. The Ministry benefits from additional outreach resources and collection of data about health conditions on the island. And, the people of St. Maarten have greater access to health screenings and information in their own neighborhood and at no cost. AUC faculty advisor for the project, Dr. Golden Jackson, Director of Service-Learning and Community Affairs, sees the project as an important step in fostering development of cultural competence and the ability of learners to connect the community experience with academic learning in a way that deepens understanding.</p>
 <p>
 At the end of the day at the initial Project H.E.L.P. event, the facial expressions from physicians-in-training and hugs from patients served as testimony of the excitement and potential felt by everyone associated with the project after months of planning and efforts required for the realization of the vision of two students.</p>

</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<div class="single" id="post-4711">
 American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) today announced Heidi Chumley, MD has been appointed executive dean and chief academic officer, effective March 21, 2013.
 <p>
 William Hughson, president of DeVry&rsquo;s Healthcare Group, said, &
]]>
<![CDATA[
ldquo;Dr. Chumley is an accomplished physician, educator, and leader who has dedicated her career to the pursuit of the same ideals that make AUC an important part of the US healthcare education system. She is committed to helping bright, talented, and committed students from diverse backgrounds to become excellent physicians.&rdquo; AUC is a part of DeVry, a global provider of educational services.</p>
 <p>
 Dr. Chumley joins AUC following an eight-year career at the University of Kansas School of Medicine, where she most recently served as associate vice chancellor for educational resources and interprofessional education. Her responsibilities included fostering a vibrant learning environment supported by technology and other academic resources, as well as developing a center for interprofessional education and simulation. She served for nearly four years as senior associate dean for medical education, responsible for admissions, curriculum, and student affairs. Dr. Chumley also led initiatives in rural health, and cultural enhancement and diversity.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I am excited to be joining AUC, an outstanding education-focused medical school,&rdquo; said Dr. Chumley. &ldquo;In today&rsquo;s environment of budget cuts to medical education, AUC plays a critical role by providing physicians for the U.S. healthcare system.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Dr. Chumley earned her medical degree from the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, where she also completed her residency in family medicine and a fellowship in academic leadership. From 1999 to 2004, she practiced in the University Health System in San Antonio. A native of Texas, Dr. Chumley received her bachelor&rsquo;s degree in biochemistry from Abilene Christian University. She has been recognized with national awards for teaching, leadership, and scholarship, including the Parke Davis Award for Clinical Teaching, the Association of American Medical Colleges Early Career Women Faculty Professional Development Award, and numerous awards from the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine.</p>
 <p>
 Her appointment to lead AUC comes as the School continues work on a $30 million expansion of its St. Maarten campus to support continued academic excellence. She succeeds Dr. Bruce Kaplan, who served as executive dean and chief academic officer of AUC since1997. &ldquo;Under Dr. Kaplan&rsquo;s leadership, AUC has developed into a school whose culture is infused with the drive for institutional excellence,&rdquo; said Hughson. &ldquo;Our students&rsquo; perseverance, our faculty&rsquo;s commitment to teaching, and our alumni&rsquo;s dedication to service are all reflections of Bruce&rsquo;s core values.&rdquo; Dr. Kaplan has been appointed vice president of clinical strategy and dean of postgraduate medical education for DeVry Medical International, a DeVry subsidiary, which provides administrative and other support to AUC, as well as other DeVry institutions, such as Ross University School of Medicine and&nbsp; Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine.</p>

Students Serve Local Community Through Project HELP
]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<div class="single" id="post-4728">
 <p>
 A new community service program developed in part by students at the American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) aims to promote good health for residents of Sint Maarten.</p>
 <p>
 Project HELP (Health Education Literacy and Prevention) was started by physicians-in-training Nimish Sudan and Malary Mani, in collaboration with the Sint Maarten Ministry of Public Health, Social Development and Labor. Project HELP plans to hold monthly health events throughout Sint Maarten, where AUC students will gain valuable hands-on experience assisting local physicians with screenings for heart health and blood pressure, as well as eye and ear checks and educational workshops on diet and exercise. These health checks will also provide the Department of Public Health with a more informed view of the health of the Sint Maarten population and promote health awareness.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;The study of medicine is a great privilege with an accompanying social responsibility to patient-centered research, public health and community service,&rdquo; said Dr. Ronald Testa, AUC dean of medical sciences. &ldquo;In its goal to educate uninsured and underserved residents about health risks and indicators, as well as prevention of illness, Project HELP exemplifies AUC&rsquo;s core mission.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 The first Project HELP event will be held on Saturday, April 6, 10:00 a.m. &ndash; 1:00 p.m. at the Community Help Desk in the Dutch Quarter. Screenings are complimentary.</p>

HIV Screening Committee of AUC Volunteers at HIV Testing Day
]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<div class="single" id="post-3385">
 Over the years The HIV Screening Committee of AUC has worked with the St. Maarten AIDS Foundation to organize free community HIV testing days. This year, 45 student volunteers tested 146 people at the Charles Leopold Bell School in Cole Bay.<br />
 <p>
 Anita Pabani, fourth semester student at AUC became involved with the St Maarten AIDS Foundation as a student volunteer and then as student coordinator. She said, &ldquo;My previous work with sexual abuse and rape survivors encouraged interested in helping the community in St. Maarten through HIV awareness and counseling.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Prior to the event, AUC students were trained as testers and counselors by the&nbsp;St. Maarten AIDS Foundation founder, Dr. Gerard&nbsp;Van Osch and his colleagues.</p>

 <p>
 Their poster, entitled &ldquo;Atrial Septal Defect Causing Underestimation of Mitral Regurgitation in a Severely Symptomatic Patient,&rdquo; highlighted the critical role played by transesophageal echocardiography in the identification of subtle intracardiac lesions and the assessment of patients with dyspnea on exertion that is unexplained by other modalities. A missed atrial septal defect may impact appropriate and timely management of patients with symptomatic mitral regurgitation. Delayed treatment may result in right outflow track remodeling and lead to residual pulmonary hypertension.</p>

AUC Alum Attains Dermatology Residency at the University of Ottawa

<div class="single" id="post-5356">
 <p class="page-title">
 When Laura Pickett, MD &rsquo;11, discovered that there were only two dermatology residency slots allocated to international medical graduates in Canada, she felt disheartened. Despite graduating at the top of her class at American Univ
]]>
<![CDATA[
ersity of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) and having exceptional exam scores and credentials, the odds were still stacked against her. But the determination that initially propelled the Sterling, Ontario, native to leave a five-year mechanical engineering career and follow her dream of becoming a physician sprang into action and she went for it</p>
 <p>
 Her efforts paid off. Pickett, who matched into one of the two competitive spots, is slated to start her dermatology residency at the University of Ottawa, in Ontario, this July.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;If you are going to be that person who is going to go for it, you are already in a better position than a lot of other people who have already decided they aren&rsquo;t going to try,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;If there is somewhere you want to be and something you want to be doing, then give everything you have and go for it.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 This attitude, coupled with academic excellence, has followed Pickett since childhood. Although she always knew she wanted to be a doctor, a high school guidance counselor suggested she complete a degree in engineering prior to applying for medical school since she excelled in the sciences. In addition, the counselor advised that engineering would afford Pickett a good degree to &ldquo;fall back on&rdquo; should medicine not &ldquo;pan out.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 So, after earning a bachelor of science degree with honors in mechanical engineering from Queen&rsquo;s University in Ontario, Pickett was offered the first job she applied for and decided to give it a try. During her five years in the field, however, she still felt a calling for medicine tugging at her heartstrings.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Every article I picked up, every newspaper I read, every magazine I was interested in was always health-related,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I had a great job, but I never felt proud of what I was doing and was never really excited about it.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Pickett finally decided to leave her job and go to medical school after volunteering at Belleville General Hospital, where she finally felt a sense of pride in what she was doing.</p>
 <p>
 At about the same time her husband, Tim, whom she had met at the engineering company they both worked for, also decided to embark on a career change and become a chef. Hence, in 2008, the supportive, career-changing spouses embarked on an adventure that would fulfill both of their dreams.&nbsp; AUC was the perfect choice, said Pickett, since the School offered the US-based curriculum she required, and the island of St. Maarten &ndash; informally known as the gourmet capital of the Caribbean &ndash; afforded her husband with a fruitful environment for an aspiring chef.</p>
 <p>
 And although she admits living in the Caribbean for those two years &ldquo;took some adjustment,&rdquo; Pickett says she greatly enjoyed her time in St. Maarten and appreciates that the School prepared her well for a career in medicine.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited to go back for graduation and thank the professors for everything,&rdquo; Pickett said. &ldquo;I feel I got a great education [at AUC]. I think they gave me the foundation to get there.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 The solid foundation and high scores earned during her pre-clinical education propelled Pickett to be accepted into competitive clinical rotations, including one at the University of Toronto and one at McMaster University, which gave her an edge during residency interviews, she explained. But it was the opportunity to complete her core rotations and a dermatology clerkship at Ealing Hospital in London, she admits, that presented her with one of her &ldquo;biggest breaks.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;My [University of Ottawa residency] interview was in front of 12 physicians, so it was pretty intimidating. They were extremely impressed with the fact that I [completed rotations] in the UK,&rdquo; she recalled. &ldquo;When I mentioned the dermatologist I worked with [at Ealing], Professor [Anthony] Chu, they actually knew who he was. He is that well-known.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 It was her rotation with Chu that solidified Pickett&rsquo;s desire to specialize in dermatology, even though she says her interest in dermatology dates back to childhood. One of the cases that left a lasting imprint on her was a 16-year-old patient who had been so impacted by severe acne that he was on the brink of suicide by the time his parents took him to see Dr. Chu. According to Pickett, the patient was completely cured of the acne and left with virtually no scars, and is now leading a productive life.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I find the skin fascinating, and underestimated a lot of the time,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;When people have issues with their skin, whether they are physical or even cosmetic, it impacts their lives in a huge way. When things are wrong with people&rsquo;s skin, it can severely impact their quality of life.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Pickett says she is excited to begin her residency and learn more about dermatology. For Canadian students wishing to match back home, Pickett had this advice: do well on exams, as the match process in Canada is heavily based on test scores. In addition, she added, try to obtain elective clerkships in Canada, and most importantly, plan ahead.</p>
 <p>
 Ready to embark on the five-year residency journey, Pickett said she is happy to set up home in Ottawa with her husband and seven month-old son, Owen, after being uprooted for the past four years. Not that the young doctor is complaining; it was well worth it the effort, she said, and the rewards are priceless.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Looking back upon it was such a short period of time. Now for the rest of my life I get to be doing what I want to be doing, where I want to be doing it,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<![CDATA[ AUC Breaks Ground on $30M Expansion of Campus ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<div class="single" id="post-3579">
 The American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine (AUC) has graduated more than 4,500 physicians since its founding in 1978. The school marked a new chapter in its history on May 26, as members of the St. Maarten government, AUC leadership, and officials from DeVry Inc. gathered for a groundbreaking ceremony to commemorate the start of the initial phase of an extensive expansion of the St. Maarten campus.
 <p>
 The first phase of the campus project, budgeted at around $30 million, will include construction of two new academic buildings housing an anatomy lab, clinical skills training lab, and simulation center, as well as additional study and learning spaces for students. It is the single largest building project in the history of DeVry, which acquired AUC last summer and immediately committed to significant investments in the campus infrastructure.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;This is a momentous occasion for both the AUC School of Medicine and the St. Maarten community,&rdquo; said Andrew Jeon, MD, MBA, president of AUC. &ldquo;By joining together to break ground on the campus, we are recommitting ourselves to our mission of educating compassionate and capable healthcare professionals to serve society. These new buildings will be the heart and soul of the AUC campus.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Jeon was joined in the ceremonial first dig by Bill Hughson, president of DeVry&rsquo;s Healthcare Group; AUC leadership; and members of the St. Maarten government, including Prime Minister Sarah Wescot-Williams and Deputy Prime Minister William Marlin.</p>
 <p>
 Prime Minister Wescot-Williams said she was pleased to see DeVry moving forward with the project &ldquo;just a short nine months&rdquo; since acquiring the school. &ldquo;DeVry is good for AUC and will be a good partner for St. Maarten,&rdquo; she said, adding that her government would continue to explore economic-zone legislation to benefit AUC and other similar institutions.</p>
 <p>
 Deputy Prime Minister Marlin noted that the campus project &ldquo;will help expand the economy of St. Maarten.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Ron Testa, PhD, AUC&rsquo;s medical sciences dean, said the campus development will have a significant impact on the AUC student experience. &ldquo;This allows AUC to follow through and even strengthen our commitment to high academic standards by providing our students with an environment that will support their efforts for success,&rdquo; he said.</p>
 <p>
 The two new academic buildings are slated for completion by August 2013, in time for AUC&rsquo;s fall semester.</p>

<![CDATA[ 2011 AUC Annual Faculty Symposium Recap ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<div class="single" id="post-1977">
 <p>
 The recently held 2011 AUC Annual Faculty Symposium brought a sensibility of the practical application of what medical science students have learned so far and offered a greater understanding of the clinical experiences they will encounter during the last two years of medical studies. The purpose of the annual three-day affair is to acquaint the visiting clinical faculty with the medical science faculty and students by way of a meet-and-greet social and guest lectures among others.</p>
 <p>
 The symposium, held on June 7th &ndash; 9th, provided a medium to highlight student-faculty research and the activities of student organizations. The event also provided ample networking opportunities for students.</p>
 <p>
 From lectures on medical licensure to popular topics on psychiatry, three lecture halls full of clinical site representatives, research presentations and a &lsquo;meet-and-greet&rsquo; social, the symposium provided something for every interest.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Overall, I found the entire symposium to be really helpful in preparing me for what to expect as a fifth semester student,&rdquo; commented second semester student and current SGA secretary, Christine Cave.</p>
 <p>
 The student-focused lectures and info sessions engaged individuals like medical science students Carlos Aguirre, Savreet Kaur and Chukwudi Mbagwu who gained an idea of what lies ahead after attending Dr. Manny Agah&rsquo;s lecture concerning &lsquo;Things You Should Know for the Pediatrics Rotation.&rsquo;</p>
 <p>
 Another highlight was the Clinical Hospital Fair where there were faculty clinicians representing more than 20 of AUC&rsquo;s affiliated hospitals located throughout the United States and United Kingdom.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I thought the symposium was great. I especially enjoyed visiting the representatives from the New York clinical rotation sites since I am a New York resident,&rdquo; said Cave. She also appreciated that representatives from the Office of Clinical Student Affairs were available to address any student concerns.</p>
 <p>
 While browsing the UK room, fourth semester student Ini Ukonne was pleasantly surprised to see a photograph of her peer Monica Cheriyan working alongside a physician while rotating at a hospital in England. Cheriyan recently completed some of her clinical rotations in the UK.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just nice to have so many options in terms of clinical sites because it adds variety to our scope of medicine and prepares us for what we may see in practice,&rdquo; said Ukonne on the possibility of rotating outside the U.S.</p>
 <p>
 Students were excited to hear of the newly acquired sites. As he exited one of the last scheduled symposium lectures, Aguirre captured the day best by saying, &ldquo;This year&rsquo;s symposium was legendary and really informative.&rdquo;</p>

milar to that of many others who have decided to join their spouses or significant others away from home during medical school.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a challenge, but it works out OK,&rdquo; &ndash; she said, especially since she and the kids get the chance to provide a positive support system for Michael as he makes his way through the Medical Sciences curriculum at AUC.</p>
 <p>
 Before moving to St. Maarten, Cheyenne found support from AUC&rsquo;s Spouses Organization (SO), a group that serves as the foremost resource for students and their loved ones. As part of the network, families receive guidance and support before their move, as well as assistance to adjusting to life on the island.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;The Spouses Organization is your first link to the island,&rdquo; said Cheyenne. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great way to get people going and planning. When you&rsquo;re here, everyone gets together and does things &ndash; it&rsquo;s a great support system.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Jackie Rouff, whose husband Mark is also a student at AUC, is an active member of the SO. She and Mark married in 2009, and moved to St. Maarten from Arizona in early 2011.</p>
 <p>
 Before the move, Jackie reached out to the SO and inquired about life on the island. She was paired with a sponsor, a service offered to any incoming spouse or significant other.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I was feeling a bit overwhelmed before coming to the island and I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to expect or who to ask questions to,&rdquo; said Jackie. &ldquo;I emailed the organization and they set me up with a sponsor, Jamie Grove, and she helped me out so much!&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 The transition was a smooth one, Jackie said, but she got antsy after a few weeks of being out of work.</p>
 <p>
 In Arizona, she worked as an enrollment advisor for the University of Phoenix and also owned a children&rsquo;s fitness center, which she sold before her move.</p>
 <p>
 Jackie has her bachelor&rsquo;s degrees from Arizona State University in Child Development and her master&rsquo;s in Elementary Education from the University of Phoenix and currently works part-time at one of the local schools in St. Maarten.</p>
 <p>
 She privately tutors children on different days of the week and sometimes works as a substitute teacher.</p>
 <p>
 The McGlues&rsquo; relocation has also been seamless because the family enjoys traveling.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Michael thought about three main schools &ndash; and he wanted to be able to get into an accredited program,&rdquo; said Cheyenne, who previously worked as an Emergency Medical Technician. &ldquo;I told him it also had to be somewhere where the family could have fun while he was away. AUC was the best about communicating and getting back and showing interest and caring. They were the first ones to say yes and we said OK.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Michael and Cheyenne met while both were studying at the University of New Mexico. They moved to Golden, Colo., after Michael got a job there working as a representative for a biotech company.</p>
 <p>
 But the work got monotonous, and Michael wanted to do something more rewarding. Apprehensive at first about going back to school &ndash; Michael already had a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Communications and a master&rsquo;s degree in Business and Health Administration &ndash; he made the decision to pursue an M.D. after a little pep talk from Cheyenne&rsquo;s father.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;My dad went to medical school when I was in eighth grade and he had five kids, he was 42,&rdquo; said Cheyenne. &ldquo;He told [Michael], well you&rsquo;re younger than me, go for it.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 After getting accepted to AUC, the McGlues sold their property and moved to St. Maarten.</p>
 <p>
 And Cheyenne is using the island as a learning experience for her sons. She developed her own teaching program with some assistance from the boys&rsquo; teachers in Colorado and has incorporated island activities &ndash; such as snorkeling &ndash; into her lesson plans.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;We do marine life, we do a lot with the weather. Everything that you run into here, you just kind of make it a teaching lesson. You take all those lessons and explore more into them,&rdquo; said Cheyenne.</p>
 <p>
 She also lets her boys have fun.</p>
 <p>
 Recently, Dillon and Ronan joined the Windy Reefs Surfing Club. When Michael has breaks from school, the family ventures out to the beach and to other parts of the island.</p>
 <p>
 When Mark has down time from school, he and Jackie try to enjoy activities on the French and Dutch side of St. Maarten.</p>
 <p>
 During Mark&rsquo;s first break, the two snorkeled at Dawn Beach and watched the sunset from Cupecoy Beach. They also dove and snorkeled by Creole Rock, Le Galion and Mullet Beach.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;In March we were able to enjoy Tuesday nights in Grand Case, listening to music and checking out the local vendors,&rdquo; said Jackie. &ldquo;We have also been to Arts in the Plaza at Porto Cupecoy and enjoyed meals at several restaurants and earlier, we were actually able to squeeze in a day trip to St. Barts and a day on a catamaran to watch the Regatta.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Jackie said she enjoys living on the island, but misses family and friends.</p>
 <p>
 She wouldn&rsquo;t have made a different decision, though.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;We both just wanted to make sure it was the best choice and we both agreed that the only way we were doing this adventure was together.&rdquo;</p>

 Recently, Dillon and Ronan joined the Windy Reefs Surfing Club. When Michael has breaks from school, the family ventures out to the beach and to other parts of the island.</p>
 <p>
 When Mark has down time from school, he and Jackie try to enjoy activities on the French and Dutch side of St. Maarten.</p>
 <p>
 During Mark&rsquo;s first break, the two snorkeled at Dawn Beach and watched the sunset from Cupecoy Beach. They also dove and snorkeled by Creole Rock, Le Galion and Mullet Beach.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;In March we were able to enjoy Tuesday nights in Grand Case, listening to music and checking out the local vendors,&rdquo; said Jackie. &ldquo;We have also been to Arts in the Plaza at Porto Cupecoy and enjoyed meals at several restaurants and earlier, we were actually able to squeeze in a day trip to St. Barts and a day on a catamaran to watch the Regatta.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Jackie said she enjoys living on the island, but misses family and friends.</p>
 <p>
 She wouldn&rsquo;t have made a different decision, though.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;We both just wanted to make sure it was the best choice and we both agreed that the only way we were doing this adventure was together.&rdquo;<br />

<![CDATA[ AUC Students Assist with HIV Screenings ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<p>
 As part of an ongoing relationship with St. Maarten&rsquo;s Aids Foundation, a group of fifth-semester AUC students recently assisted the organization with an HIV Screening in Philipsburg.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;We wanted to screen the Haitian Population, so we chose to do an HIV testing event on Haitian Flag Day,&rdquo; said Jesus Vargas. &ldquo;Although the turnout was low &ndash; we tested 51 people &ndash; it was a great experience for the volunteers because it was their first time experiencing this activity. We used both the oral swab and finger prick rapid test to do the screening for HIV.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 The event took place on Sunday, May 22, 2011, and was one in a long list of outreach efforts that AUC students undertake during their time on the island.</p>

<![CDATA[
<p class="page-title">
 As a professional BMX racer, Harley Kelley got to see the world. He raced in Canada, Puerto Rico, Latvia, and France, just to name a few locations, and competed in three world championships &ndash; one as an amateur and two as professional.</p>

port, and experiencing the injuries that came with it, gave him a view of patient care and emergency medicine that a lot of people don&rsquo;t often get to see.</p>
 <p>
 So much so that it intrigued him to pursue medicine as a career.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;The injuries that go with [BMX racing] became a part of my life,&rdquo; said Kelley, who graduated from Stony Brook University in New York with a degree in psychology in 2005.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;The truth is that I&rsquo;ve always had the desire to push myself to do things I never thought were possible. Eventually the thought of imagining myself as a physician got stuck in my head.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 So far, so good.</p>
 <p>
 Kelley is in his fourth semester of his Medical Sciences curriculum at AUC, and will start his clinical rotations in 2012. His goal is to be an emergency medicine physician.<br />
 <br />
 Being involved in BMX racing gave him a solid foundation of focus before starting medical school.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;It taught me how to discipline myself to do something that&rsquo;s un-pleasurable in the short run (sprint sessions, workouts, eating healthy), and endure it so I can accomplish anything I set my mind to. I know the hours I spend in the library, will allow me to be the best physician I can, and give me the honor and privilege to have people put their lives in my hands,&rdquo; said Kelley, who started racing when he was 12.</p>
 <p>
 Being in the spotlight &ndash; Kelley was a national champion and ranked 7th in the world&ndash; also taught him how to act like a professional.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I think the most amazing moments are when you can make a difference in the lives of others. For instance, I got to give a bunch of my racing gear away to a few children who had cancer. Getting letters back from those kids and their families will never leave me. I sent one of my race helmets to one kid, and his mom told me he wore it home on the way from the post office in the car.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 He&rsquo;s looking forward to more similar opportunities, and he&rsquo;s sure he&rsquo;ll have it as a member of the medical community.</p>

A Final Stop in SXM Before Beginning Life as a Surgeon
]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<div class="single" id="post-1955">
 <p class="page-title">
 Although Heath Antoine has not yet begun his surgical residency at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, he is getting a head start on his new job by joining some of his peers on a humanitarian medical mission to Honduras on May 14.
]]>
<![CDATA[
He is anxious to get started, to say the least.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;m excited,&rdquo; said Antoine, who matched into his first choice, a categorical general surgery program at Henry Ford Hospital. He will start practicing there on June 21.</p>
 <p>
 Surgical residency positions are very competitive and the field is a difficult one to get into, as program directors customarily do not grant interviews to candidates who lack strong letters of recommendation and performance evaluation comments from their surgery rotations. Typically, students should also have a USMLE Step 1 score above 208.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s definitely more trying, mentally, physically, and emotionally, but I knew I wanted to do surgery the second I stepped into the operating room,&rdquo; said Antoine. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ecstatic to be able to pursue my dream.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Antoine chose to focus on surgery during his clinical rotations. He did his core surgery rotation at St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital in Waterbury, Connecticut, and then completed two elective surgery rotations&ndash; one month of Trauma at Henry Ford in Detroit, and one month of Surgical Oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;At St. Mary&rsquo;s, I was in by 4:30 every morning, in the OR until 6 or 7 every night, and then I went home and read up on the next day&rsquo;s cases. I learned a ton there and by the end of my third month, I was doing a Laparoscopic pleurectomy-decortication with the chief resident and chairman.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 He knows the workload will get heavy, and he&rsquo;s preparing for it.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I know come June 21, I&rsquo;m going to be in charge of a floor of patients, so every night I&rsquo;m going home and studying harder now than I probably did at any other time of the year.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Dr. Dwight Hertz, a professor of Pathology at AUC, thinks Antoine&rsquo;s hard work and diligence will pay off.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;He was high energy, always happy and very engaging. I was amazed at how well he did in school with his involvement with SGA,&rdquo; said Hertz. &ldquo;Bottom line, he has all the right stuff to be a great physician: bright, articulate, and compassionate.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Before he starts working at Henry Ford, though, and after he returns from Honduras, Antoine has one final &ndash; and important &ndash; assignment to complete on the island of St. Maarten.</p>
 <p>
 On May 28, he will be delivering the commencement speech to his fellow graduates.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;It was quite humbling actually to be chosen not only by our deans but then validated by my peers to speak,&rdquo; said Antoine. &ldquo;Being able to go up there before my classmates, professors, and everyone&rsquo;s family and friends and hopefully relay to them a little bit about our struggles in medical school, our successes, and our perseverance to finish medical school and gain entrance into competitive US programs is such an honor.&rdquo;</p>

isit the program&rsquo;s website to gather more information.</p>
 <p>
 Douglas Tanita, M.D., thinks having a well designed, informative page may be the key to better attract potential applicants.</p>
 <p>
 That is why Tanita, a 2007 AUC graduate, delved into the topic as part of his research project during his Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology residency at Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg, Fla.</p>
 <p>
 Bayfront requires all of its residents to complete a research project and submit it for publication.</p>
 <p>
 Tanita submitted his findings to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a nonprofit organization of women&rsquo;s health care physicians. His work was accepted, and he presented it at the ACOG national conference in early May.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my first really big study that I have done and I really like it,&rdquo; said Tanita, who grew up in San Diego, Calif., and received his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Biological Sciences from the University of California in Santa Barbara.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Going through this process helps residents get a better understanding of the journals that we read. As doctors, we need to read these studies and get a better understanding of how good the study is and whether it has enough statistical significance to change things.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 To gather information for the study, Tanita constructed a web survey and sent it out to 216 recently matched PGY-1 OB/GYN residents in the United States. Data was collected using a 1-10 scale and divided into three categories: Less Influential (1-3), Moderately Influential (4-6), Very Influential (7-10).</p>
 <p>
 Of the 179 participants who responded, 68 percent reported that program websites played a moderate or very influential part in their decision on whether or not to apply to a program.</p>
 <p>
 Eighty percent believed that being able to navigate the site with ease was a very important component of a program&rsquo;s website.</p>
 <p>
 Tanita found, though, that websites are less influential in regards to where applicants choose to interview and, to a lesser extent, how to rank a program.</p>
 <p>
 The Bayfront website was recently revamped, and Tanita helped the web developer put the residency page together. He still manages the day-to-day operations.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;It was a necessity and people said the website looked a lot better than what it was before,&rdquo; said Tanita, who is in his fourth year of residency. &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s more user friendly for multiple browsers.&rdquo;</p>

<![CDATA[ A Taste of Home ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<p class="page-title">
 Growing up in rural Georgia, Benji Ho&rsquo;s family would often eat vegetables they grew in their garden and fish they raised in their lake.</p>
 <p>
 Dinner was always a place where good food met good conversation, but Benji took more from those experiences: he paid attention to his mother&rsquo;s cooking techniques and carried her recipes with him into college.</p>
 <p>
 Now in medical school at AUC in the country of St. Maarten, Benji uses his time in the kitchen as a way to take a break from studying.</p>
 <p>
 And he writes about it on his popular website, &ldquo;Diary of a Caribbean Med Student,&rdquo; a <a href="http://www.caribbeanmedstudent.com/">blog</a> where he posts about his life as a second year medical student at AUC.</p>
 <p>
 There, wedged between notes on USMLE scores and study tips are blurbs on Lotus Root, where to find the best Asian products, and reviews of restaurants on the island &ndash; a new feature Benji added to his blog on March 26.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Cooking is a way to relieve stress from schoolwork, since it gives your mind a break,&rdquo; said Benji, who graduated from Washington University in St. Louis in 2005 with a major in Architecture &ndash; he completed a post-baccalaureate program in premed at the University of Georgia in 2009.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;It turns over the work to the senses &ndash; tasting, smelling, feeling, seeing, and hearing.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 In St. Maarten, Benji often experiments with his meals.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I usually cook from scratch, so that means fresh vegetables, fruit, meats, rice, tofu, eggs, and flour. When I go shopping for groceries, there&rsquo;s usually not any particular dish I have in mind to make,&rdquo; said Benji.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I just get the ingredients I see are available that I like, and then decide later when I&rsquo;m cooking how to mix and match them to make dishes.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 One of his recent dishes included Tilapia sautéed with white onion, tomato, black pepper and lime. For side dishes, he had a slice of toast with a goat cheese and herb spread, green avocado, fried egg with taco sauce, and a tomato and cucumber salad garnished with cilantro, lime juice, black pepper and olive oil.</p>
 <p>
 For a sweet rush, he sliced up a navel orange.</p>
 <p>
 Finding all those ingredients in St. Maarten has not been difficult.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I can find everything I&rsquo;m accustomed to back home over here. I can even find some of the Asian vegetables my mother grows in her garden at home being sold in the supermarkets here,&rdquo; said Benji.</p>
 <p>
 While he&rsquo;s not a picky eater, Benji is certainly used to some comfort foods that stem from his Taiwanese roots.</p>
 <p>
 And he likes to share those dishes with friends.</p>
 <p>
 At UGA, Benji would often hold dinner parties, leaving friends with cravings.</p>
 <p>
 His girlfriend, Irene, who is in post-graduate school in Miami, is also a foodie.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;We love to find &lsquo;hole in the walls&rsquo;, find charm in mom and pop restaurants and try new foods from street carts,&rdquo; said Irene.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Surprisingly, I think Benji likes to cook more than I do. Good for me!&rdquo;</p>

<![CDATA[ Students Raise Funds for Victims of Japan Quake ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<div class="single" id="post-1936">
 <p>
 As visuals of the March 9th earthquake in Japan splashed across their TV&rsquo;s and computers, several AUC Student Government Association (SGA) members felt helpless and horrified. So they decided to pitch in, albeit on a small scale, and raise money for victims of the quake by producing and selling T-shirts on St. Maarten.</p>
 <p>
 All proceeds from the sales will go to the Save the Children Emergency Japan Fund, a charity whose intent is to help those affected by the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. So far, nearly $1,500 has been raised. The Christian Medical Dental Association (CMDA) has also been pitching in by raising funds through its Sunday offerings.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Over 100,000 children have been uprooted from their homes because the disaster struck during the day when they were in school,&rdquo; said Jennifer Chen, a University of California, Davis, grad and the AUC student representative for the Asian Student Medical Association (ASMA).</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;In disasters such as these, the children are overlooked. We chose &lsquo;Save the Children&rsquo; because it has a fund set aside just for the purpose of helping those in Japan.&rdquo; Chen said money from the Community Outreach Fund from SGA was used to purchase the T-shirts.</p>
 <p>
 The rest of the payment came from ASMA and out of the pockets of some students.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a chance for future physicians to do good, not only on a community level, but on an international level,&rdquo; said Jubin Jacob, a fourth semester Medical Sciences student who helped design the T-shirts, which have the red sun of Japan&rsquo;s flag on the front and the AUC School of Medicine logo on the back. The white T-shirts also have ASMA/CMDA printed on the left sleeve.</p>
 <p>
 While the tragedy didn&rsquo;t hit close to home for Jacob, the thought of such a disaster hitting St. Maarten was enough for him to push to make a contribution.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;We live on a 37 square mile island, and something of that magnitude would wipe this place out,&rdquo; said Jacob, who grew up in New York and studied cell and molecular biology at Binghamton University before enrolling at AUC.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;So that makes us more humble.&rdquo;</p>

Taking Notes: Students Published in Clinical Journal
]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<div class="single" id="post-1927">
 <p>
 While on rounds with the senior doctor during clinical rotations in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology in London at Ealing Hospital, AUC clinical students Ingrid Paredes and Marlon Pastrana were being taught the importance of consenting patients before surgery.<
]]>
<![CDATA[
/p>
 <p>
 Soon after, the two were helping construct an article for a peer-reviewed journal on the importance of such a process.</p>
 <p>
 And it all started with the snap of a camera.</p>
 <p>
 Paredes and Pastrana, who are engaged, had the opportunity to follow a patient scheduled for elective Caesarean section early that fall morning. The two were on rounds with Dr. Tan Toh Lick, who started training in OB/GYN in1998.</p>
 <p>
 During the C-section, an ovarian cyst was found after the delivery of the baby, an eventuality the patient had been counseled of during the consent process.&nbsp;The patient was informed of the finding and confirmed that she wanted to have the cyst removed.</p>
 <p>
 Paredes photo-documented the mass with permission and shared it with Dr. Tan soon after the delivery.</p>
 <p>
 Dr. Tan thought it a fortuitous coincident demonstrating the value of the consent process, and suggested that Paredes and Pastrana write an article about the importance of implementing such a practice.</p>
 <p>
 The outcome: with the help of Dr. Tan, both students got their work published in a reputable medical journal.</p>
 <p>
 The paper, after some tweaks, was printed in the British Journal of Medical Practitioners (Volume 4, Number 1) in the March 2011 edition.</p>
 <p>
 Titled &ldquo;Incidental adnexal mass at Caesarean section &ndash; the value of implementing a comprehensive consenting process,&rdquo; the article delves into the importance of drafting an in depth consent form to facilitate and document the comprehensive discussions of the surgical procedure and other risks or additional procedures that may be relevant during the surgery. The paper also notes that Ealing Hospital had adopted the use of standardized consent forms for common procedures, and that the paperwork was available for download and customization.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Sometimes doctors would write in a way that you wouldn&rsquo;t understand &ndash; but this one is typed so everyone can understand it,&rdquo; said Paredes, who, with Pastrana, is currently completing additional clinical rotations in Gainesville, Fla., at Shands Hospital.</p>
 <p>
 Paredes wants to pursue a career in OB/GYN, while Pastrana is looking to match into a neurosurgery program next year. Eventually, the two want to move back to Miami where they met and have family. Both are of Cuban descent.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;We both wanted to do medicine since we were in Cuba,&rdquo; said Paredes, who, with Pastrana, received her bachelor&rsquo;s degree from the University of Florida. &ldquo;I was 15 when I came from Cuba and he was 16 and both of our families are in Miami. Our dream is to work in that area. We feel like our Hispanic communities need us, and we want to give back.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 To be published, Dr. Tan says, is not common, especially for students.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s quite an achievement, really,&rdquo; said Dr. Tan. &ldquo;It was a joy to work with them because they were always so interested. They were helpful, and always eager in asking questions.&rdquo;</p>

<![CDATA[ Alum Wins Neurosurgery Award for Work in Africa ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<div class="single" id="post-1930">
 <p class="page-title">
 Robert Louis, M.D. (&lsquo;07) is the 2011 American Association of Neurological Surgeons (AANS) Young Neurosurgeons Public Service award recipient, for his role in helping to organize neurosurgical humanitarian relief efforts in Africa.
]]>
<![CDATA[
He will receive the award at the Young Neurosurgeon Committee&rsquo;s (YNC) annual meeting in Denver, on April 16.</p>
 <p>
 Louis, now in the fourth year of a seven year neurosurgery residency at the University of Virginia Health System, knew he&rsquo;d travel to Africa someday: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just something that I&rsquo;ve wanted to do for a long, long time.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
 <p>
 The health crisis in Africa was so disheartening that Louis said he felt compelled to do whatever he could do to make an impact. How disheartening?</p>
 <p>
 In the African nation of Tanzania, where he spent five weeks training surgeons, the patient to doctor ratio is hard to comprehend: there are 25,000 health care workers trying to serve a population of 40 million. That is 5.2 workers for every 10,000 people. By comparison, there is one healthcare worker for every 390 people in the United States.</p>
 <p>
 The numbers were even more startling in neurosurgery. Indeed Tanzania has the worst ratio of neurosurgeons of any country in the world: there is one neurosurgeon for every 13 million people, while in the United States there is one for every 65,000.</p>
 <p>
 So he hatched a plan: assemble a team of colleagues who would not just go to Tanzania, perform some surgeries and leave, but train their surgeons to perform some of the neurosurgery techniques plus pre-and post-op procedures needed to care for those patients.</p>
 <p>
 Louis used all of his vacation time to make the trip. Four other colleagues joined him and they headed to Tanzania last August with the medical mission group, Madaktari &ndash; Swahili for physician. The group trained general surgeons at two different hospitals and performed over 50 operations&mdash;head injuries, spinal trauma and removing brain tumors&mdash;and did so with very basic equipment.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;It was important to not just do the operation but to train them, so they could do some of these on their own, which is a big deal,&rdquo; said Louis.</p>
 <p>
 Louis and his team were also in for a lesson of their own &ndash; how to perform high-level surgery with unsophisticated tools.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Normally on a given day, I use $5 million worth of equipment,&rdquo; said Louis. &ldquo;While I was there, we literally had to go to the hardware store, buy screws we thought would work and other things we needed, fuse everything together and then perform our surgeries.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;As long as you sterilized it, it works. It was an eye-opening experience learning how to do things with a lot less than we&rsquo;re used to,&rdquo; said Louis.</p>
 <p>
 Since that training, the program has now expanded to seven hospitals and a neurological residency training program has been created. Medical students from the United States are also tracking the progress of the patients Louis and his team operated on.</p>
 <p>
 Dr. Louis&rsquo;s fascination with the human skull began at an early age.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I was 12 years-old. Somebody brought a cadaver brain to our science class and I thought it was the coolest thing&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 He admits to not taking his studies as seriously as he should have as an undergrad, but said he was single-mindedly focused on excelling in medical school so he could match into his dream specialty.</p>
 <p>
 His strategy worked.</p>
 <p>
 He published more than 40 research papers while at AUC &ndash; more than any student at a U.S. medical school&mdash;excelled on his clinical rotations and matched into his first choice.</p>
 <p>
 He is humbled by the YNC&rsquo;s award: &ldquo;I knew I was nominated but I was surprised that I got it, because they only give one award a year.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
 <p>
 His next mission? He heads to New Zealand in June to serve as chief neurosurgical resident at Auckland Hospital, a required year of training for his residency training.</p>

 During a recent tutoring session with high school students from the St. Maarten Academy, American University of the Caribbean, Medical School (AUC) student Arash Yazdani encountered frustration from a young girl who had trouble figuring

out the molecular formula of a chemistry problem. The girl told Yazdani that her dream was to become a doctor, but difficulties getting through the science course was discouraging her from those thoughts.</p>
 <p>
 Yazdani stopped the session and explained to the student that even he, a fifth-semester student, was having issues with certain subjects in medical school. But he told her to keep plugging away, and to not be intimidated because everything was possible with work.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Her attitude changed considerably and she started talking to me about medical school courses,&rdquo; said Yazdani, who entered AUC in 2009 after completing his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Biology at Florida State University.</p>
 <p>
 That interaction was partly the reason the AUC Honor &amp; Service Society organized the tutoring program with students on the island.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;It feels good and is a bit of a taste of reality that you lose from keeping your nose in books all day,&rdquo; Honor &amp; Service Society president Damian Salerno said.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;It gives us the same motivation for being a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 Salerno, who received his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Biology from SUNY Fredonia in New York, is currently in his fifth semester at AUC. He helped organize the tutoring program, along with Brandon Stransky.</p>
 <p>
 Salerno said the Honor Society has completed two tutoring sessions this semester, and is hoping to finish two more before May.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;The program is one way that the students give back to the community that hosts them for five semesters,&rdquo; said Dr. Cindy Stroschein, AUC&rsquo;s Interim Assistant Dean of Student Affairs and Faculty Advisor for the Honor &amp; Service Society.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;The Honor Society is a pretty self sufficient group, and they are the best and brightest, so we entrust them to come up with projects on their own.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 The tutoring sessions last approximately two hours and take place at AUC. Honor &amp; Service Society members &ndash; about 18 of them &ndash; assist St. Maarten Academy students with work in Physics, Math, and Chemistry. The Honor &amp; Service Society uses money from fundraisers to pay for the students&rsquo; bus transportation to and from the university.</p>
 <p>
 Salerno said this semester, the Society is doing a silent auction to help pay for those fees.</p>
 <p>
 The Honor &amp; Service Society is an AUC student organization dedicated to excellence in academics and community service to provide what&rsquo;s necessary for the islanders of St. Maarten. Students are only eligible to be members of the Honor &amp; Service Society when they are going into their fifth semester.</p>
 <p>
 The tutoring program hasn&rsquo;t only impacted the St. Maarten students.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I came here straight after undergrad, so in my mind I&rsquo;m still a kid that no one looks up to,&rdquo; Yazdani said. &ldquo;But working with these kids and being looked up to made me feel great, like, wow, I&rsquo;m almost a doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<![CDATA[ AUC Grad and Wife Pen Book on Child Rearing ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<div class="single" id="post-1895">
 <p class="page-title">
 Ben Boswell M.D. (&rsquo;10) and his wife Lisa Boswell, recently wrote their first book,<strong><em> Too Much Love, Too Much Discipline</em></strong>, a guide to help parents better understand the best techniques to raise children with
]]>
<![CDATA[
the right blend of love and discipline. Before attending AUC, Dr. Boswell was a Behavioral Specialist Consultant and Child and Family Therapist. He&rsquo;ll begin a Psychiatry residency at Drexel University in Philadelphia in June.</p>
 <p>
 <strong>What inspired you to write the book?</strong></p>
 <p>
 Whenever I&rsquo;m asked this question, I can&rsquo;t help but think back to a truly inspiring moment.&nbsp; Back in June 2002, my four-year old client, Evan, as his mother and I stood silently by, was at last brushing his teeth on his own&hellip; but with one hand&hellip; and with the other, he was simultaneously shoveling small handfuls of M&amp;Ms into his mouth&hellip; occasionally stopping to look up at me and smile. It was pretty hard not to laugh. Evan had recently reached other behavioral goals his mother had set: he had ceased all tantrums and physically aggressive behavior towards her and was now following her directions for the first time ever. Just months before, she had told me of the countless attempts she had made at changing his behavior and how helpless and frustrated she felt each time she failed.&nbsp; Her attempts were based on advice from friends, teachers, even pediatricians. I knew those attempts were doomed to fail from my own experiences as a Behavioral Specialist Consultant and Child and Family Therapist, working with children who exhibited varying degrees of a wide range of maladaptive behaviors in the home, school, daycare and foster care. Much of my approach back then had evolved from the questions I asked the parents of these children.&nbsp; Their surprising answers revealed how just a few missteps kept them from reaching their goals for their sons and daughters. A few actually had the answers to begin initiating positive change in their children. They would tell me in so many words that a child needs to learn self-discipline, responsibility, frustration tolerance, strong self esteem, and a respect for authority, yet when I asked them how they were teaching those lessons at home, many struggled for a response.&nbsp; The key missing piece for not only Evan&rsquo;s improvement, but every child whose parents were consistent in their follow through, was their child&rsquo;s individual strengths, weaknesses, preferences, dislikes, and the motivation behind their behavior.&nbsp; I realized right then and there the need for a step-by-step resource that could teach parents how to not only understand behavior in their own child, but also how to tailor an individualized plan to shape and change that behavior. A resource that laid out the lessons all children need to learn to be truly prepared for the real world. A do-it-yourself book on changing a child&rsquo;s maladaptive behavior that actually worked. All of that and more can be found in <em>Too Much Love, Too Much Discipline</em>.</p>
 <p>
 <strong>Can you explain the title? Are you suggesting that children can never have too much love and/or too much discipline?</strong></p>
 <p>
 The title <em>Too Much Love, Too Much Discipline</em> is essentially a mnemonic that refers to the book&rsquo;s proactive, two-pronged system that not only helps correct behavioral problems, but also teaches children major life lessons that can prepare them for a career of competence, flexibility, and success. We liken the learning of maladaptive behavioral patterns to the learning of a language. A person&rsquo;s first language is learned effortlessly and comes naturally while languages learned later in life require much more effort. Similarly, a child who has a &lsquo;first language&rsquo; of maladaptive behavior patterns requires more practice and more repetition to correct. The &lsquo;too much&rsquo; reminds parents of this fact and that they now need to do more, and create more opportunities, in order for their children to learn proper behavior.</p>
 <p>
 <strong>How did you juggle medical school with the demands of writing a book?</strong></p>
 <p>
 Once Lisa and I decided to go ahead and write the book, the big question was<em> how</em> to write it. We came up with what we thought was a novel solution and a unique way to circumvent the clinical jargon, making the book as helpful, easy-to-grasp, and easy-to-follow as possible for our readers: I would provide the raw data and anecdotal information and Lisa would actually write the book from a layperson&rsquo;s perspective. To do that, we taped literally hundreds of hours of our conversations and discussions when I wasn&rsquo;t in class, and Lisa would then write when I went back to class or was studying. Our goal was to simulate a series of in-the-home interactions between a parent and myself. &nbsp;These interactions would involve an assessment of an individual child&rsquo;s situation and the subsequent formation of a strategy to help him or her achieve success.</p>
 <p>
 <strong>What are you hoping to match into this spring?</strong></p>
 <p>
 Fortunately, thanks to AUC&rsquo;s curriculum and student preparation, I don&rsquo;t have to wait. I recently pre-matched at Drexel University in Philadelphia, my first choice, and will be beginning my PGY-1 in Psychiatry this June. To complete my medical education, I plan to do a fellowship in Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.</p>

<![CDATA[ AUC Grad Awarded Prestigious Fellowship ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<div class="single" id="post-1">
 <p class="page-title">
 John Lusins III, MD (&lsquo;06) has received an American Psychological Association (APA) Psychiatric Leadership&nbsp;Fellowship.</p>
 <p>
 The fellowship is a two-year award which offers psychiatric residents, with exceptional leadership potential, many different experiences that prepare them for leadership roles.<br />
 <br />
 Those selected participate in a component of the APA governance structure, attend the APA Annual and Fall Component Meetings, present a workshop at the Annual Meeting, receive leadership training, visit innovative psychiatry programs and are assigned to a prominent psychiatrist for individual mentoring.<br />
 <br />
 Dr. Lusins&rsquo; passion for psychiatry blossomed during his winter breaks in college when he shadowed physicians at hospitals in his native Oneonta, NY.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;My two weeks on the psych ward changed my life.&nbsp;The interplay between biology, genetics, psychology, and pharmacology has fascinated me since,&rdquo; Lusins said.<br />
 <br />
 But he admits that he considered other specialties.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;During my medical school&nbsp;years other areas pulled my interest away for a short period of time,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Lusins. &ldquo; But the daily interaction with the personal lives and difficulties of psychiatric patients always pulled me back.&rdquo;<br />
 <br />
 While at AUC, Dr. Lusin was actively involved with the school community. He served as the Judge Advocate of Phi Chi Medical Fraternity, was a recipient of the Dr. Susan Atchley Community Service Award and was Class Speaker at his graduation.<br />
 <br />
 He is halfway through a four-year psychiatry residency at West Virginia University where he serves on several committees, ranging from Graduate Education to Ethics and is a current board member of the AUC Alumni Association.<br />
 <br />
 As an APA fellow, he will travel to APA headquarters in Washington D.C., and attend meetings. He will serve on the Council for Advocacy and Government Relations and is looking forward to the experience.<br />
 <br />
 &ldquo;To be recognized for excellence in the presence of so many talented colleagues and applicants is truly something I could only dream of,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Lusins.<br />
 <br />
 Added Lusins: &ldquo;The award adds further focus&nbsp;on how I can impact psychiatry and the field of medicine as a whole.&rsquo;&rsquo;<br />
 &ldquo;I plan to have a career in academic medicine and an award such as this provides not only education in the field of leadership, policy creation, and legislation, but also affords extensive networking with like-minded colleagues.&rdquo;</p>

<![CDATA[
idea where she gets these things,&rsquo;&rsquo; says Smith as he thanks her.</p>
 <p>
 Smith, Lilly and his wife Kathy are in Melbourne, Fla., packing up their belongings for a move to Michigan where next month he begins his clinical rotations at Providence Hospital Center.</p>
 <p>
 After two years at the American University of the Caribbean in St. Maarten&minus; where he learned the rigors of fatherhood while simultaneously juggling sleepless nights to study for copious exams&minus; he&rsquo;ll begin this phase of his medical school career with an astounding accolade: a Step 1 score of 258/99, a stunning feat by any standard and yet it&rsquo;s not something he dwells on.</p>
 <p>
 His simple advice to students preparing for the same exam: &ldquo;Learn the stuff as well as you can when you&rsquo;re doing it so all you&rsquo;re doing [before the exam] is reviewing stuff that you already know pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 That&rsquo;s it. No major fanfare or celebration. He has a U-haul truck to pack full of possessions in a few days.</p>
 <p>
 Smith indeed is a modest guy whose journey to medical school is somewhat circuitous.</p>
 <p>
 He majored in food science and human nutrition as an undergraduate at the University of Florida with a minor in military and classical studies.</p>
 <p>
 He had a dual love for the military and medicine, love affairs fostered throughout his childhood.</p>
 <p>
 His step-father served in the army, his grandfather served in the navy and as an engineer for NASA who was responsible for designing many of the medical experiments that took place aboard shuttles and during space missions. His uncle, Dr. Henry Floyd &rsquo;81, is an AUC&nbsp; alumnus who is now a radiologist in Orlando, Fla.</p>
 <p>
 He couldn&rsquo;t shake the image of the Sept. 11 attacks from his memory. The call of the military won.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I knew medical school would be my path eventually, but when I got into college I wanted to go to the army more,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
 <p>
 As an ROTC member he was commissioned as an officer. He was deployed in April 2006.</p>
 <p>
 But there was another love story afoot.</p>
 <p>
 He&rsquo;d fallen in love with his best friend Kathy while studying at the University of Florida. The two married in a City Hall ceremony in December 2005, just four months before his deployment.</p>
 <p>
 It was a bittersweet start for their marriage said Kathy.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;While most couples are adjusting for married life, we were spending our first year apart,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.</p>
 <p>
 Luke lucked out with an internet connection in his barracks so they communicated via email and video chat as often as they could. She sent care packages and cards each week.</p>
 <p>
 And she stayed busy by pursuing a master&rsquo;s degree in psychology.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;School is what kept me busy. If it were not for the exams and papers, I probably would have stayed glued to CNN the entire time Luke was deployed,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said.</p>
 <p>
 Luke, in turn, faced the realities of war.</p>
 <p>
 His platoon searched daily for insurgents and scoured the streets of Baghdad for improvised explosive devices.</p>
 <p>
 Injury and death were constant.</p>
 <p>
 His platoon once checked an area for IEDs and found none. Minutes later a second team was hit by the hidden explosives. A soldier was killed instantly.</p>
 <p>
 The memory of that dying soldier lingers.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;There weren&rsquo;t a lot of good days in Iraq. You just made the best of what each day would bring,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Smith.</p>
 <p>
 In the midst of fighting to stay alive he&rsquo;d also decided to pursue medical school once he&rsquo;d completed his&nbsp; tour in Iraq. He searched for IEDs by day and studied for the MCAT at night.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I decided to go to med school there, partly because of what I saw,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
 <p>
 It was now April 2007 and his year in the battlefield had come to an end. He had served his country and remains proud he says, but the best moment of his days at war was the day he and every single person from his platoon made it home.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;We brought our entire unit home, we didn&rsquo;t lose anyone,&rsquo;&rsquo; Smith said. &ldquo;I was happy to be home.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 So was Kathy.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;The day Luke returned home from Iraq is a vivid memory that I will carry with me for the rest of my life,&rsquo;&rsquo; she said. &ldquo;We had done it and our love was stronger on his return.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
 <div id="attachment_658">
 <p>

 </div>
 <p>
 Kathy would finally be able to plan the wedding she&rsquo;d dreamed of.</p>
 <p>
 That June, the two exchanged their vows before 200 family and friends.</p>
 <p>
 Then their lives snowballed with three major events happening within a 10-month period: Luke&rsquo;s acceptance and enrollment at AUC, the end of his army career and the birth of their daughter Lilly.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Everything had to happen to plan, there was little room for error,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Kathy.</p>
 <p>
 But plans have a way of going off course.</p>
 <p>
 Lilly arrived three weeks early. She was just six weeks old when they arrived on St. Maarten.</p>
 <p>
 Despite Luke&rsquo;s rigorous schedule as a student, teaching assistant, tutor, orientation advisor and member of the judiciary committee, the family survived the rigors of medical school and even thrived they say, because of their experience with the military. Kathy also credits the <a href="http://aucspousesorganization.wordpress.com/">spouse&rsquo;s organization</a> for being a tremendous source of support to help wives and significant others cope with being home alone. She served as the group&rsquo;s vice president.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;The army made me thankful for the time we had as a family,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Kathy. &ldquo;Luke was gone a lot, but he always made time for the family.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
 <p>
 Even when he would spend 12 hour stints at the library or when they lost power on the island for the fourth time in a day, she had no complaints: &ldquo;I was happy he was home at night and not on a bunker in Baghdad.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
 <p>
 Though his basic sciences days are behind him, Smith encourages incoming and current students to find an outlet away from studying to help maintain a balance.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen too many students just study without ever taking a break and now they&rsquo;re burned out and failing,&rsquo;&rsquo; Smith said.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Take breaks, have a relief. Go to the beach. Enjoy the island and when you&rsquo;re studying, do it with a group. It&rsquo;s a great way to sit there and talk amongst yourselves, plus it makes it fun because it isn&rsquo;t the monotony of just sitting there reading by yourself,&rsquo;&rsquo; he said.</p>
 <p>
 Smith is still undecided about what he&rsquo;ll eventually specialize in but is excited about the different areas he&rsquo;ll see in action during his rotations at Providence.</p>
 <div id="attachment_659">
 <p>
 Smith, with Kathy and daughter Lilly at the beach on St. Maarten at Christmas</p>
 </div>
 <p>
 And he is grateful more than anything to Kathy for sacrificing her own career so he could pursue his. She&rsquo;ll pursue her doctorate in psychology once they settle on a permanent home when he graduates.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Without Kathy&rsquo;s support, I would not have been able to succeed in medical school,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Smith.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo; Having her and Lilly there with me was a fantastic support system, and each day I could see why I needed to work as hard as I could to succeed,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Smith.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Kathy was very patient with the long hours of study, the hectic schedule, and the rigors and uncertainty of island life.&nbsp; She really was the secret to my success.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

<![CDATA[ The Traveling Doctor ]]>
</title>
<description>
<![CDATA[
<div class="single" id="post-78">
 <p class="page-title">
 It&rsquo;s early morning and Jody Sadler, M.D. (&rsquo;09), is zipping across major highways clocking a few hundred miles from Champaign, Illinois to Georgia. The Atlanta Braves are playing and Sadler, born in the home of the Braves, is a serious fan.</p>
 <p>
 Music from Christian and country music artists like Jeremy Camp, Kenny Chesney, Garth Brooks and Tim McGraw keep him company inside his white Honda CRV.</p>
 <p>
 Sadler, student speaker at the upcoming commencement ceremony, is as passionate about travel as he is medicine.</p>
 <p>
 How much so?</p>
 <p>
 He scheduled his residency interviews so he could travel across the country. He logged 20,000 miles on that five month odyssey, driving from New York to Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Dallas, Oklahoma and New Orleans &ndash; twice.</p>
 <p>
 He also planned his clinical rotations in the United Kingdom to satisfy his thirst for new adventures. While there, he saw Bon Jovi at Wembley Stadium in London, walked the beaches in Barcelona, went skiing on the Swiss Alps, partied at the Ayia Napa on the island of Cyprus, Greece, visited the Guinness brewery in Ireland and saw the Mona Lisa in Paris.</p>
 <p>
 His lives by this simple motto: &ldquo;I gotta have a good time.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
 <p>
 On St. Maarten, Sadler ― who matched in his first choice and will start his pediatric residency at Oklahoma Children&rsquo;s Hospital in July ― was equally adventurous.</p>
 <p>
 He sailed in two Heineken Regatta&rsquo;s and got scuba certified, he visited Saba and experienced great hiking, he visited Anguilla where he swam with dolphins, lounged on Shoal Bay Beach, and saw his 10th Jimmy Buffett concert.</p>
 <p>
 He&rsquo;s as adventurous as it gets says friend Lauren Smithson, M.D (&rsquo;09).</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Jody managed to get all of us involved in the Heineken regatta, along with three professors, and we had a blast racing between two boats, taking turns at the helm, the cranks, and all the other boat bits I forget the names of. It was a memory to last,&rsquo;&rsquo; Smithson said. &ldquo;He is always up for anything, and that is pretty good for a Southern boy.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
 <p>
 But don&rsquo;t be fooled by Sadler&rsquo;s wanderlust. Having a good time yet maintaining a rigorous work ethic was key to surviving medical school on a tropical island he said.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;You have to be very disciplined. There are a lot of temptations on the island,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Sadler who noted that some students never made it beyond basic sciences for that very reason.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I decided to hit it hard, study my butt off and then play. You&rsquo;re in paradise you might as well get the most of it but remember that the end goal is to be a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 While he had some misgivings about going to a foreign medical school, Sadler says it was the best decision he could have made.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I went to AUC because I didn&rsquo;t get into medical school in Georgia but my view is that you can&rsquo;t let the stigma drag you down,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Sadler.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen some of our students who just have it as a monkey on their back and they accept it and my thinking is, just get out there and bust it,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Sadler. &ldquo;There is no reason why you can&rsquo;t get a 99 on the USLME. Work hard for it and you can achieve it.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
 <p>
 Though determined to have a good balance between his adventurous spirit and studies, Sadler also became engrossed in extracurricular activities. He was a member of the Student Government Association for five semesters, a member of the Christian Medical and Dental Association. He also worked closely with the ICAN orphanage to enhance the lives of the children they cared for. In fact, it was his volunteer work with the orphanage that solidified his decision to become a pediatrician.</p>
 <p>
 Sadler, who recently completed his Step 3 exams, has spent the few months before residency traveling and tutoring students for USMLE review with the Physician Assisted Student Success or PASS Program. He&rsquo;s also working closely with Director of Community Affairs Dr. Sue Atchley to return to AUC for future lecture series focused on preparation for the USMLE and U.K. clinicals.</p>
 <p>
 The traveling doctor has also done the unthinkable: he bought a house.</p>
 <p>
 But he swears the adventures will continue.</p>
 <p>
 What&rsquo;s next?</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I need a wife,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I know, I know it&rsquo;s funny especially since I haven&rsquo;t dated much because of all the traveling, but why not? Now&rsquo;s as good a time as any.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>

 <br />
 Dr. Labitan, MD, ABFP, FAAFP, MBA, is a 1987 graduate of AUC and a former student government president. He is a physician, author, and value investor who prefers to be called &ldquo;Bud&rdquo; by his friends and readers. He has published 2 books on value investing and is a well known figure in the value investing community. His first book in 2008 was called &ldquo;The Four Filters Invention of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger &ndash; Two Friends Transformed Behavioral Finance.&rdquo; His second book of 2010 is called &ldquo;Price To Value&rdquo; and it will soon be available on Amazon.com as well as Lulu.com</em></p>
 <p>
 <strong>Tell us about your years at AUC/Montserrat?</strong><br />
 I studied at AUC on Montserrat from 1985 until clinical clerkships in Chicago, Ill., at Martha Washington Hospital and Mary Thompson Hospital. I graduated June of 1987 and started my family practice residency in July of 1987. I was fortunate to pass the FMGEMs as a senior; and fortunate to pass the ABFP in 1990 shortly after completing my residency in Family Medicine in Gary, Ind.</p>
 <p>
 <strong>Best moment on the island?</strong><br />
 I was asked to give the Student Commencement Address by Dr. Paul Tien, the founder of our school. When I returned to the island for graduation ceremonies, they had just completed a new two- level office building for the faculty.</p>
 <p>
 <strong>When you attended AUC were you thinking of writing a book someday?</strong><br />
 No. In those days I was a fun-loving young man who just wanted to become a good family physician and live close to my family in Munster, Ind. We enjoyed the challenge of study and played a little basketball in the late afternoon.</p>
 <p>
 <strong>How did this book evolve?</strong><br />
 After running my own private practice for seven years from 1990-1997, I left medicine for two years and did software development for a company in Chicago called the Information Management Group in 1998 and 1999. While there, I was part of a two-man team who built the Arthur Anderson Partner Performance Scoring Software. Arthur Andersen LLP, based in Chicago, was once one of the &ldquo;Big Five&rdquo; accounting firms, and it out-sourced this project to IMG, Inc. The frontend was in Microsoft Access and the backend was in SQL Server.</p>

 My first book evolved after 12 years of being a fan of the value investing style of Warren Buffett and his teacher Benjamin Graham. I became so interested in business philosophy that I enrolled in an MBA program at Purdue University Calumet (PUC) in Hammond, Ind. It was an accelerated 18-month program called MBA of Executives that covered all the courses given at their main campus. The first book evolved from my notes and knowledge of the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Letters to Shareholders. At PUC, Dean Shomir Sil allowed me to do research on a behavioral finance area for my senior project.&nbsp; I decided to study the Graham/Buffett/Munger approach to framing an investment decision. That eventually turned into my first book in 2008 called &ldquo;The Four Filters Invention of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 <strong>What would you say to students/graduates who have a secondary passion and how can they reconcile that passion with a hectic work schedule?</strong><br />
 Eventually, you will move into the area of your greatest interest. The medical education is a good knowledge base upon which you build up your skills in subjective and objective evaluation.</p>
 <p>
 <strong>Are you still practicing medicine? </strong><br />
 In addition to being an investor, software designer, writer, Visiting Clinical Instructor in Family Medicine at Indiana University School of Medicine &ndash; Northwest, I have also been practicing part-time in Whiting Medical Center in Whiting Indiana as a Family Physician. Now, I am a candidate for President and CEO of a local FQHC; Federally Qualified Healthcare Center. So, the book writing may slow down for a bit.</p>

 Providence Hospital was again ranked as one of the nation&rsquo;s top 15 major teaching hospitals by one of the country&rsquo;s leading sources of health care information and research.&nbsp; The recognition from Thomson Reuters released

today, recognizes hospitals that achieve or exceed national benchmark scores for hospital-wide performance. Providence was the only hospital in Michigan to be selected in the Major Teaching Hospital category of Thomson&rsquo;s 100 Top Hospital&rsquo;s list. This is Providence&rsquo;s fourth appearance on the list.</p>
 <p>
 The award honors an elite group of the national award winners. Everest Award winners have reached the highest level of accomplishment on the national Balanced Scorecard and have the fastest rates of long-term improvement. Providence was also one of only 23 hospitals in the country to be named a winner of Thomson&rsquo;s Everest Award.</p>
 <p>
 The recognition is especially poignant for the American University of the Caribbean community said Chief Academic Officer Dr. Bruce Kaplan.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Providence Hospital was AUC&rsquo;s&nbsp;first clinical clerkship hospital,&nbsp;starting in approximately 1982. Currently, the Chair of Radiology, Cardiology, Head of Echocardiography, and many other prominent members of the Medical Staff are AUC alumni, many of whom&nbsp;also did their clerkships and residency at the same institution,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Kaplan.</p>
 <p>
 Kaplan noted that AUC currently plays a prominent role in&nbsp;medical education&nbsp;[at the hospital] by supplying students for core clerkships and elective rotations. The hospital also boasts many AUC alumni as faculty, has several AUC deans and the Chief Academic Officer, who serve as key&nbsp;teachers and administrators&nbsp;to facilitate excellence within the medical education department.</p>
 <p>
 The Thomson study examines performance across five critical areas: clinical outcomes such as lower mortality rates, patient safety, operational efficiency, financial stability and growth. The study also determined that hospitals such as Providence treat sicker patients requiring more complex care, yet have better patient outcomes and lower costs. According to the Thomson study, the 100 Top Hospitals have higher survival rates, keep more patients complication-free, and attract more patients all while maintaining financial stability.</p>

<![CDATA[ Students Make Strides in Vaccination Research ]]>

<p class="page-title">
 In today&rsquo;s world of diversity, cultural melding and vast range of socioeconomic conditions, it is crucial for physicians to be culturally competent, understanding and appreciative of human differences. With that in mind, a group of 22 AUC students took part in a Pan Am

erican Health Organization(PAHO) vaccination coverage survey in September 2008.</p>
 <p>
 AUC students, as well as several St. Martin University students, partnered with PAHO (a regional branch of the World Health Organization) and St. Maarten&rsquo;s Sector Health Care Affairs (SHCA), to act as the field survey arm of the research. Under the guidance of James Dobbins, Ph.D., of PAHO, and Joseph Ichter, AUC&rsquo;s director of public health research, the student volunteers were not only responsible for collecting data on children&rsquo;s immunization, but also educated on the research and survey processes.</p>
 <p>
 The first survey consisted of randomly sampled data from 37 geographic divisions across Dutch St. Maarten. Children between the ages of 12 and 59 months were identified by choosing a single home, and each survey team would then continue visiting contiguous homes until eight children meeting the sample criteria were found. The second survey used a blanketing methodology to identify and record immunization records of all children in the same age group, but in very limited geographic areas. The latter was meant to obtain more detailed coverage of those areas known to have a significant number of undocumented immigrants in their demographic.</p>
 <p>
 AUC students were able to gather invaluable data that will help improve the island&rsquo;s immunization policy.</p>
 <p>
 According to Ichter, St. Maarten modified its vaccination policies after a 2002 report showed coverage of only around 60 percent of children. The revised policy, enacted after the initial report, included free vaccinations for all children in hopes of encouraging parents to continue the process in spite of economic or citizenship barriers.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;The 2008 survey was meant to show how that policy may have affected childhood immunization rates,&rdquo; explained Ichter.</p>
 <p>
 According to Ichter, an initial look at PAHO&rsquo;s analysis showed that the cumulative number of children immunized at the correct time in the first year was exceedingly low &mdash; about 10 percent &mdash; far short of the goal of 90 percent.When looking at the 52nd week of age, however, the rate increases to 85.2 percent and, by the end of two years, that rate reaches 89.6 percent.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;This is well below the WHO&rsquo;s recommended target rate of 95 percent,&rdquo; Ichter said. &ldquo;Obviously, the target wasn&rsquo;t reached, but on the other hand, a vast improvement was made from the 2002 rates.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 The experience taught the students about the importance of public health research in informing health care policies. This is especially true in regard to children&rsquo;s immunization, an issue of special interest to tourist destination communities such as St. Maarten.</p>
 <p>
 The project also showcased the diversity of AUC&rsquo;s student body. The group of student researchers collectively spoke five languages, namely English, Chinese, French, Portuguese and Spanish, and were able to complete the island-wide survey in only three days.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;When I realized that a language barrier could be in the way of collecting the data, I had to reassure the parents that was not a problem and switch to one of the other languages I speak,&rdquo; said third-year student Briza Junqueira, who is fluent in Spanish.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I would encourage every medical student to participate in this type of project. In the future, we will have to be as flexible and willing to accommodate the needs of our patients,&rdquo; she added.</p>
 <p>
 The opportunity to be part of a project that can bring improvement to the island undoubtedly enriched the lives of those who volunteered &mdash; both on a personal and professional level.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;I felt it was an eye-opening experience to venture away from the tourist attractions and into the residential areas where the local people live and witness them in their daily lives,&rdquo; third-year student LindseyWhiteman noted. &ldquo;[I realized] that even though it&rsquo;s another country, values and familial bonds are exactly like our own.&rdquo;</p>
 <p>
 AUC students have also volunteered in two dengue research platforms, one focused on how patients contracting dengue accessed the health care system, while the other was a case-control study centered on risk factors of the disease during epidemics. Another research project being conducted is helping the local health care system develop a case-based evaluation tool for their new community nursing LPN program in St. Maarten.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;More projects are in the works,&rdquo; said Ichter.</p>
 <p>
 &ldquo;Once the more encompassing research agreement is completed with the governments of St. Martin/St. Maarten, we expect to be able to expand the research through grant applications,&rdquo; he said.</p>
